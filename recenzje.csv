1,"Films like Mission: Impossible live and die by suspension of disbelief. As long as the action is entertaining and the stars charismatic, it's amazing how much audiences will accept even as the story spins the hokeyness into overdrive.

But eventually such things always lead to diminishing returns. At some point, no matter the production value, there is a point where the wow-factor just isn't enough anymore.

Which isn't to say that Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One is not entertaining. Far from it. By all accounts, it is precisely what it promises to be: a thoroughly exciting showcase of amazing stunts, beautiful people in gorgeous locations, and baffling acrobatics from one of the last global superstars.

And yet, following the near-perfect action thriller that is Mission: Impossible – Fallout, Dead Reckoning feels less than the sum of its parts.

The reason for that is twofold. Firstly, Dead Reckoning is only the first part of two films and, at two and a half hours in length, is wildly overlong. By the time we reach the finale, it feels like the entire film could have been just an opening preamble. The kind of setup adventure we see before the opening credits.

Secondly, the plot doesn't make a lick of sense. And yes, I understand the argument that Mission: Impossible films aren't made for things like plot. They're excuses for globetrotting sexy espionage. I dare anyone to coherently explain the story of any previous film in the series and not break into hysterics.

Which brings us back to diminishing returns. After two decades of spy shenanigans, there comes a moment where the ludicrousness reaches a tipping point. For me, it's pitting Ethan Hunt against a rogue AI.

Dead Reckoning's plot is a contrived series of technobabble and IT ignorance. In it, a computer virus gains sentience and goes rogue, earning the title of The Entity by global authorities.

Described as a doomsday device that can access everything, do anything, and be anywhere it wants to the point of effectively predicting the future, The Entity can only be stopped by acquiring its source code, which gives the power to either control or destroy the parasitic digital creation.

Complicating matters are a missing Russian submarine and a cruciform key to unlocking something within it. As Ethan and his team race to find the interlocking pieces to the key, they must also discover what they key unlocks – and where.

How much you'll enjoy Dead Reckoning depends entirely on how many questions you had reading that plot description. If you couldn't help but wonder what the key and the AI have to do with one another, or why everyone is racing after a secondary MacGuffin when the source code is right there, you'll probably have the same hangups as I did.

On the other hand, if such things don't bother you, Dead Reckoning will be a hoot.

Neither of these is a bad thing.

But in prior Mission: Impossible films, I didn't stop to think about these kinds of things. It didn't matter that Hunt's plan to infiltrate the Kremlin with a fake wall and a mask was ludicrous and silly. I couldn't care less that climbing the Burj Khalifa was Hunt's idea of a solid plan to get into a server room one floor below his.

That's because their outlandishness goes hand in hand with the dramatic strength of the story. In both cases the plot drove the action. We knew the plans were drastic and stupid, but they were also driven by necessity. There was a reason to the madness, no matter how flimsy.

In Dead Reckoning, that flimsiness is so pronounced you can practically see the bubblegum holding the plot together at its hinges. When the enemy is an all-powerful, all-knowing Entity that can literally do anything it wants, the plot and the stakes become meaningless.

It no longer feels like a scenario where Hunt will win by his smarts, but by the convenience the script dictates him to. So, in turn, the action sequences feels like they're padding a one-sided conflict. The people out to stop Hunt are all meaningless. Remove any one of them and the film remains the same. An entire major action set piece is so irrelevant that if you cut it completely, nothing in the story changes.

The story no longer drives the action, and action without story, no matter how dazzling, makes for dull viewing.

Another particularly jarring moment comes midway through the film. Hunt and his team must chase one of villains through winding streets in an unfamiliar city. Just moments ago, they've established that the AI can do anything and be anywhere at any given time. For reasons unexplained, they put their faith in the same digital instruments they just explained were untrustworthy.

It's one of the times that calls for the suspension of disbelief. There must be a reason why they're doing this. But it doesn't work, because Dead Reckoning spends so much of its runtime explaining things to the audience. Every scene that isn't an action sequence is a collection of people in a circle telling each other what just happened in the story.

Often, they do so by finishing each others sentences – even when it's a bunch of strangers meeting for the first time.

This is the kind of clunky expository dialog that even veterans struggle to get through unscathed. It's information that characters already know, delivered in such a graceless manner that even those who are looking at their phones can keep up.

Which, in turn, forces Dead Reckoning into odd tonal shifts and a bumpy pacing reminiscent of a car with gear trouble. Every time you think it's finally picked up the pace, it knocks back into a slower speed without warning.

In a sense, it's a marvel that despite all of this, Dead Reckoning is still an entertaining film. To extend the car metaphor, it's the kind of comfortable ride that's so familiar you're willing to put up with the inconveniences, because you know how good it gets when it's firing on all cylinders.

But Dead Reckoning also suffers from that familiarity. It's a victim of its own high standard. By now, we know how superlative the Mission: Impossible series can be. Anything less feels like a step down, and a step down felt unthinkable until now.

It's more than likely that Dead Reckoning Part Two will smooth things out when it releases next year. After all, judging an unfinished story is unfair. But that's an issue of its own making. This is not a story that requires two films, and splitting them a year apart and five hours in length is foolhardy.

Because right now, most of Dead Reckoning is a lot like spinning plates. Yes, it's still a visually impressive trick that requires expert coordination and discipline. Sure, it's spectacular that most of the plates are on fire. And yes, I will happily come and see what happens in the finale.

But it's still just a bunch of spinning plates.",no
2,"Have you ever really lived until you've seen Tom Cruise dangling off an exploded bridge, or using a vertiginous mountainside as an Evel Kneivel-style motorbike ramp?

Audiences have long been awaiting Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning – Part One, which for four years has suffered production delays, interrupted repeatedly by the initial outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic and its various resurgences. With such a long and convoluted road to audiences, expectations have grown high: what would Tom Cruise's death-defying stunt work and the nous of Christopher McQuarrie, director of two prior well-loved iterations of the franchise, have in store for us?

For the most part: all the excitement we would expect. Sure, a confusing plot hole sometimes appears, but Cruise, one of our greatest living movie stars, just jumps through it, usually from a great height. We're too busy being absorbed into the exotic locations, or the iconically life-like face masks, or a knife-fight on top of a speeding train.

This time around, Ethan Hunt is faced with the mysterious and all-consuming power known as The Entity, a sentient AI that has the ability to infiltrate and manipulate information in every major world government, banking system, internet or satellite-based tech: whoever controls it effectively controls the entire planet.

Hunt and his team (the reliably great Ving Rhames and Simon Pegg on comms throughout) are faced with chasing down two interlocking parts of a key to The Entity's source code – and racing against some villainous types who have aligned themselves with The Entity's power, including Gabriel (Esti Morales, convincingly slick and amoral), a vicious foe with little regard for human life.

Meanwhile, in some of the film's most crackling non-action moments, the film introduces Grace (Hayley Atwell, a charismatic presence who brightens every scene she's in), a slippery international thief whose slick operations in art and jewellery heists have given her some poise under pressure – which she will need.

The film does make some amusing jabs at the algorithmic and the automated in the form of its evil AI enemy (also, as it goes, the real-life enemy of Cruise's beloved old-school filmmaking and practical effects). But Mission Impossible is best when it is dispensing with narrative excuses to get to the action, which it does with an almost nod-and-wink level of self-awareness.

In that respect, the movie is a marvel of physical jeopardy and Hollywood setpieces par excellence: every car crashing crunch of metal, every walloping thud of a body falling. You get the sense these people really are being banged around; that they are made of flesh and blood rather than superhero rubber and magic.

Whether screeching through Roman traffic in a yellow Fiat 500 or trying to stop a runaway train from veering disastrously off its tracks, McQuarrie's Mission Impossible is at its most thrilling when it's all full-throttle, or in simple and powerful close-up of Tom Cruise, himself a kind of feat of Hollywood engineering at its finest. Much like 007, these are the kinds of movies where the sparkle covers over any silliness.",yes
3,"The first Mission Impossible film was released in 1996. A cinematic adaptation of the popular television show, many were dubious that Tom Cruise had what it took to play super spy Ethan Hunt, and yet he easily proved himself as a viable action man. In the intervening, almost thirty years, the franchise has expanded, with Cruise returning to play Ethan many more times, gaining a team of loyal teammates along the way. In 2023 Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning arrived and heralded the endgame for the franchise. Now, two years later, comes the eighth film in the series and the conclusion to Hunt's epic adventure, Mission Impossible: Final Reckoning. 

This last outing is also the Mission Impossible series' longest film, clocking in it at 2 hours and 49 minutes. Whilst some films make the most of an extended run time, Mission Impossible: Final Reckoning squanders its entire first hour in favour of a 'previously on Mission Impossible' exposition formula, setting up the mission that will take the final two thirds of the film to explore. Each and every aspect of things to come is explained in great detail, using footage from the previous blanks to fill in vital information. The decision to spend the first hour revisiting scenes from the past in order to set up what is to follow does at least mean that people can forgo rewatching all the previous films prior to watching. There is no need for a refresh as all pertinent information is woven into the story. 
Tom Cruise plays Ethan Hunt in Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning from Paramount Pictures and Skydance.

Once the exposition heavy first hour is dispatched, Mission Impossible: Final Reckoning kicks into high gear. As Ethan and his team race across the globe to stop the Entity, the film becomes consumed with constructing death-defying stunt set pieces. And boy are those stunts impressive. Throughout the series, Tom Cruise has steadily become obsessed with pushing his body to the limit, undertaking tasks that would have even the most seasoned stunt person baulking. Along with the typical scenes of Cruise running and fighting, the franchise has become infamous for at least one crazy stunt; for his final mission, Cruise has several up his sleeve. From a claustrophobic deep-sea dive, to an epic fight upon a bi-plane in flight, Cruise and the stunt team behind him have created some incredibly breath-taking feats, with McQuarrie capturing them from enough angles that there is no denying that it is Cruise himself pushing the limits. 

Stripped of the high-adrenaline stunts, the plot of Mission Impossible: Final Reckoning is not as strong as those that have come before. It is, however, still a step up from the muddled mess of Dead Reckoning, but for a film that spends its first third putting pieces into position, the payoff from a narrative perspective is not as strong as the swan song deserves. Ethan is given little chance to develop, remaining his usual superhuman self. It's a committed performance from Cruise, but one that relies on his physicality rather than emotions to convey his character. Given that this is the last chapter of the story, it is a shame that Ethan is not stretched more, and little about what unfolds feels like this is definitively the last Mission Impossible film.

Outside of Ethan Hunt, there are plenty of returning faces from other films in the series. Many get more screen time than they did in Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning, but with the exception of Pom Klementieff's Paris, there is little progression for anyone. Paris steals almost every scene that she is in, and newcomer Tramell Tillman lights up the screen upon his introduction. Rather than developing these characters and letting this group of talented actors shine, the cluster are stuck reading lines that don't quite feel authentic, with a surprising onus on eyebrows to convey much of the characters' thoughts. 

Ultimately the character work is a massive let down, but then this is a film with a firm focus on spectacle. Mission Impossible: Final Reckoning is one last trip with cinema's craziest spy. A film meant to conjure shock and awe, this last Mission Impossible is an action extravaganza set to open the summer season of movies with a mighty bang.  

A vast improvement from the previous film, Mission Impossible: Final Reckoning is a showcase of Tom Cruise's stunt prowess and contains plenty of eye-catching action sequences, but fails to properly stick the landing of one of action cinema's longest franchises.  ",yes
4,"In a year with a bizarre amount of Part One movies, Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One stands above the others. An intense and engagingly intricate action film, it flies by in spite of its two and a half hour length. A prime display of spectacle at its finest, it will be mind boggling if this isn't among 2023's best blockbusters come the end of the year.

Rather than an ambitious syndicate or a corrupt government cell, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) finds himself facing off against A.I. in this film. A computer programme called The Entity has gone rogue, and its intelligence is only continuing to evolve. The superpowers of the world, including the IMF that Hunt works for, believe they can control The Entity, while a mysterious man from Hunt's past named Gabriel (Esai Morales) sees The Entity as the natural next step of life. However, Hunt recognises how dangerous this programme is to humanity as a whole. Reassembling his team, he searches for a missing key that can supposedly access and help destroy The Entity – a key that Gabriel and the world's major powers are all after too.

Mission: Impossible is one of those franchises that has largely maintained a consistent quality while simultaneously pushing the envelope of what action movies can showcase. Dead Reckoning Part One features a myriad of awesome set pieces and stunts that we've come to expect from this franchise. This includes the jaw dropping motor bike cliff jump that was advertised everywhere last year, a climatic train sequence that leaves butterflies in your stomach, and even a car chase through Rome that coincidently mirrors one seen in Fast X, albeit this does it much better. The fact that most if not all of these sequences are authentic, and not the work of CGI as seen in far too many blockbusters this year, tightens the vice grip this film has on its audience.

This is sublime action filmmaking as the shot composition and direction spectacularize the set pieces while never forgetting the character driven stakes that give them weight beyond how cool they look. The wide and long takes of Fraser Taggert's cinematography showcase the grand scale of what is happening, all while intense close ups on the characters and the riveting musical score emphasise the constant stress and rapid decisions that the characters have to make when in the moment. It's a rollercoaster of thrills in which characters have to think on their feet and respond to the moment when their plans are thwarted or intercepted by The Entity and those aligned with it.

With A.I. on the rise, having exploded in usage this year, there is an unexpected timeliness to the film that perhaps even the team behind it did not foresee. While originally a concept limited to sci-fi movies like The Terminator, the usage of A.I. here is surprisingly potent. Ethan Hunt is a man who values humanity above all else, so to see him face up against an opponent with no attachments, emotions or discernible weaknesses is a rather compelling choice. Not only does it turn the IMF's reliance on technology against them, but it makes for a thematically interesting showdown. The Entity follows hard calculated logic where Hunt follows his gut instincts and grounded belief in the value of humanity. The film decries the dangers of A.I., especially when it is left unchecked like in this case. Director and co-writer Christopher McQuarrie has a passionate belief in people, and his exploration on how A.I. threatens humanity through a cold and calculated lack of empathy is as heavy as some of the action.

It is an immensely fun film that offers thematic food for thought. But appreciation of this element is not necessarily required to enjoy its story and characterisation. Blending a good mix of easily identifiable stakes and intricate psychological strategizing that feels like six dimensional chess at times, it is a film with constant momentum and breakneck pacing. At its heart are the characters, whose strong levels of engagement and identifiability are often overlooked in favour of the set pieces. The returning players are as fantastic as ever – namely Cruise's borderline unhealthy dedication to stunt work – but the new characters really embolden the themes and electrifying pace. Hayley Atwell plays a shady thief caught in the crossfire who serves as a unique foil to Hunt, while Morales is quietly intimidating as Gabriel, a man who sees The Entity as a God to be served and fundamentally rejects the things that makes Hunt the protagonist.

Its commitment to genuine cinematic awe alone makes Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One worth the price of admission. But the fact that it feels like its own film despite being part one of two – something that is achieved by having a distinctive goal in this film that is resolved by the climax – just demonstrates the skill that went into its craft. It features an exhilarating narrative with compelling characters, strong contemporary themes, and action sequences that are so stunning it is almost unfair to other movies. The Mission: Impossible franchise have offered some of the best blockbusters in modern cinema, and Dead Reckoning Part One continues that trend with astute confidence and visceral intensity. Part Two cannot come soon enough.",yes
5,"Last summer, the movie business had been all but pronounced dead. Conventional wisdom said that audiences, locked out of theaters by the Covid pandemic (remember that?), were now permanently captured by streamers. Then Top Gun: Maverick roared into wide release to the tune of $1.5 billion, and by the end of the year, Paramount had reversed course, proclaiming that the studio would only produce films intended for theatrical release.

The rest of 2022 and 2023 have turned out to be fairly average years, box-office-wise. Numbers are down from 2019, which was a banner year thanks to Avengers: Endgame, but nothing like the catastrophe of 2021. Then, there were the twin failures of Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania, which lost Marvel/Disney $120 million, and the $200-million bath Warner Bros. took on The Flash, which may end up being the biggest box office flop of all time.

Then, on May 2nd, the Writers Guild of America went on strike against the studios, and last week, the Screen Actors Guild joined them on the picket lines. Now, the doom and gloom is back in Tinseltown. The problem that the last few months has exposed is this: The alleged break-even point for a film like The Flash is $600 million. (I say ""alleged"" because ""Hollywood accounting"" is synonymous with ""lying."") This is not a business model; it's a gambling addiction. And none of it is the fault of the writers who are paid a pittance by the flailing gamblers, or the actors, most of whom don't earn the $27,000 a year necessary to qualify for SAG's health insurance.

Enter Tom Cruise and Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One. Director Christopher McQuarrie and the returning Impossible Mission Force had their budget and schedule blown by Covid delays, but promised a big on-screen payoff. They delivered on that promise.

The film's dense, fast-moving cold open harkens back to the franchise's roots as a Cold War-era spy series. The Sevastopol, a Russian nuclear submarine testing out a new AI-powered stealth system, is discovered and fired upon by an American sub. When they return fire, the American sub is revealed to be a WarGames-style computer mirage, and their own torpedo turns against them. Meanwhile, back in Washington, CIA Director Kittridge (Henry Czerny, returning) is briefing DNI Denlinger (Cary Elwes) on the Entity, a cyberweapon that achieved sentience and escaped into the wilds of the internet after sinking the Sevastopol. Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise, running) is dispatched to retrieve a key that may be the key to controlling the rogue AI. But Hunt and IMF ops Benji (Simon Pegg) and Luther (Ving Rhames, sitting) have other ideas. Burned by six films' worth of betrayal and disavowal at the hands of their bosses, they decide that no one can be trusted with the Entity's power, and vow to destroy it.

MI represents both the good and the bad of Hollywood in 2023. It is a $295-million film in a 25-year-old franchise built around an aging movie star and an intellectual property whose origin few remember. But unlike butt-ugly CGI fests like The Flash and Quantumania, all that money is on the screen. Yes, there's CGI in MI, but that's really Tom Cruise jumping a motorcycle off a cliff in the Alps. When the climax pays tribute to The General, they really drive a locomotive off a real bridge, just like Buster Keaton. Yes, it's too long (geez, this is only part one?), but the story is clear and the editing brisk. Unlike too many big-budget gambles, I never felt bored and ripped off. Plus, Tom Cruise fighting an AI in the middle of a strike triggered by a threat to replace actors and writers with AI is just too perfect. I'm rooting for Cruise.",yes
6,"When it comes to maintaining believable action hero status, you'd have to say it's Mission accomplished for Tom Cruise, as he reprises the role of Ethan Hunt for the seventh instalment of the spy franchise. Shot back in 2021, he might not look as fresh-faced as he did when he started out in Brian De Palma's first instalment but he can still sprint with the best of them and his character has gained a compelling world weariness along the way.

This time out, the mission - which, spoiler alert, he chooses to accept - is to find two halves of a key that does indeed holds the key to stopping a rogue Artificial Intelligence - known as 'The Entity' - that has the potential to wreak havoc in global security systems and a lot more besides. If anything the potential dangers of AI are even more in the news now than when the film was shot, making it feel bang up to date. Meanwhile, the addition of needing something as old fashioned as a two-part physical key to stop it feels like an enjoyable nod to the original television series. Whatever the ins and outs of the set-up, it's the action that we're here for and regular Cruise collaborator director Christopher McQuarrie delivers - in fact, arguably, over-delivers - on that score.
Copy picture

A nifty opening sequence, set upon a Russian stealth submarine, really shows what The Entity can do without too much unnecessary exposition and after that the film starts to get its sprinting shoes on. There's horse riding in the desert involving Ethan's old collaborator Isla Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), an enjoyable race against everything from time to the authorities in Abu Dhabi's soon-to-open Midfield terminal before he finds himself unexpectedly teaming up with an expert pickpocket, Grace (Hayley Atwel) in a bid to get the key.

All of which sees Ethan and Grace heading to Rome along with Isla and fellow cast regulars Luther (Ving Rhames) and Benji (Simon Pegg).

The Italian capital offers another glamorous backdrop for the action, although its here that less would be more. A car chase scene involving Ethan and Grace being handcuffed together may be full of clever stunts but it outstays its welcome. It has its moments but there's a sneaking suspicion that McQuarrie and his co-writer Erik Jendresen couldn't decide which plan of action to go for so went for all the options end on end insead.

The dialogue also suffers from cliche, although thankfully when you have actresses of the calibre of Vanessa Kirby - who reprises her role as the villainous White Widow - intoning ponderous lines like, ""The world is changing, truth is vanishing, war is coming"" it helps considerably. The cast, which also includes Esai Morales as The Entity's human helpmate Gabriel, are also strong enough to deliver the emotional beats when needed.

Other things to look out for are, of course, the heavily touted motorbike jump off a cliff - for which Cruise prepped with 500 skydives. Also, whose pulse doesn't quicken at the thought of a fight on and train? What really makes it feel fresh, aside from Cruise's remarkable vitality, is that it isn't scared to be playful, because of that anything that would normally feel cliched, feels more like a sort of nostalgic knowing nod. It's a neat trick.",yes
7,"Dead Reckoning Part One continues the tradition of impressively ridiculous action set pieces that's been in  place since the Burj Khalifa sequence in Ghost Protocol (remember in M:I III when we only saw the final shot of Ethan obtaining the Rabbit's Foot in Shanghai? Good times). Cruise and director Christopher McQuarrie have perfected their formula: cram so much action in that audiences don't care how repetitive the plots have gotten.

Case in point: the ""Entity,"" as the AI is referred to throughout the movie, has insinuated itself into every nook and cranny of our defense and resource infrastructure. This naturally poses a threat to everything from our national security posture to the Earth's air and water. Sounds pretty bad, and shockingly implies that — in an alternate universe — perhaps the Spaceballs were a tool of the Entity as well.

In McQuarrie, Cruise has found a director he trusts to make multiple movies with (several are tied with two each, including Spielberg, the Scotts (Tony and Ridley), Zwick, and Liman). The pair's collaboration began with 2008's Valkyrie, which McQuarrie wrote, before he went on to direct Cruise in 2012's Jack Reacher. Dead Reckoning Part One will be the third M:I movie he's directed (he also co-wrote Ghost Protocol), with Part Two coming in 2024, barring any more pandemics.


Side note: how pissed was McQuarrie when he found out Fast X also used the Spanish Steps for one of their car chases? He had to know Cruise wasn't about to be dissuaded from getting his obligatory motorcycle sequence in. Maybe that's why McQuarrie passive aggressively refused to provide onscreen labels for locations he thought we should already know (Venice, Rome).
In a just world, Tom Cruise would be cameoing on Agent Carter.
The core cast is still solid, though Ving Rhames's Luther is visibly weary in his scenes. Rebecca Ferguson continues her streak of excellence, and franchise newcomer Hayley Atwell (as Grace, a thief caught up in the IMF's shenanigans) seems game for everything. Gabriel, as portrayed by Morales, is a formidable opponent, but any talk of him being the best M:I villain is off base. He is, at heart, a tool of the Entity. Compare/contrast with Philip Seymour Hoffman's Owen Davian in III and it's not even close.

In the film's defense: the stunts are reassuringly gonzo, the fight scenes refreshing coherent, and it practically demands a big screen experience. At the same time, we're seeing the telltale signs of franchise bloat.",yes
8,"Seven films deep into a series that began when Bill Clinton was running for his second term, Mission: Impossible has defied the odds by not only not sinking into mediocrity, which is the usual pitfall of extended film series, but getting better and better. Despite its inauspicious beginning as one of the many based-on-an-old-television-series would-be blockbusters in the mid-1990s and having been helmed by five different directors over two and a half decades, the series has consistently evolved, innovated, and clung tight to what works. In other words, it does exactly what good genre films do: It gives you something new within the comfort of the familiar.

Of course, despite all the many personnel changes over the years, the one consistency in the Mission: Impossible series has been Tom Cruise, the producer-star for whom the series now seems all but tailor-made. It didn't really seem that way back in 1996, when Cruise was coming off a two-year hiatus following his controversial lead role as the vampire Lestat in Interview With the Vampire (1994). He hadn't done a straight action film since Days of Thunder (1990), and his willingness to anchor a movie version of a '60s television series that was best remembered for its catchy theme music seemed a bit desperate at the time. It turned out, of course, to be one of the best career decisions he ever made.As the title indicates, Mission: Impossible—Dead Reckoning Part One is the first part of the series' two-part grand finale, and you can sense Cruise feeling the need to pull out all the stops. At 61, his believability as an action hero is reaching its logical end (one that Sylvester Stallone refuses to acknowledge), but you wouldn't know it from Dead Reckoning Part One, which has him engaging in all manner of death-defying feats in the name of protecting the world from Entity, a run-amok artificial intelligence system.

Each entry in the series has offered at least one grandiose stunt sequence—Cruise rock climbing without a rope (Mission: Impossible II), clinging to the outside of the Burj Khalifa tower (Ghost Protocol), or performing a HALO skydive (Fallout)—that functions both inter- and extratextually. That is, these sequences work like gangbusters within the films themselves as moments of pure action exhilaration, but then they also work as a marketing tool in ensuring that the audience knows that Tom Cruise really did that. In an era of digital trickery in which computers can make it appear that anyone can do anything, there is something remarkably resilient and satisfying in knowing that Cruise really leapt from a plane 25,000 feet in the air, really climbed on the side of the world's tallest skyscraper, or, in the case this film, really rode a motorcycle off a cliff, paraglided, flew a helicopter, and dangled from a detached train car hanging on the edge of a gorge.

Of course, such sequences have meaning beyond themselves because they are embedded in an engaging narrative. Returning director Christopher McQuarrie, who co-wrote and directed the previous two films in the series, as well as the Cruise-starring Jack Reacher (2012), knows the importance of narrative and character, and he and co-screenwriter Erik Jendresen (Band of Brothers) deliver plenty of both—so much so that the films runs 2 hours and 43 minutes, the longest in the series so far. Yet, it never feels long or drags, partially because McQuarrie and Jendresen keep the story constantly moving forward while alternating between big action set-pieces and more suspenseful character-driven standoffs, which gives it an invigorating rhythm that keeps you glued.

Once again, Cruise's determined IMF (Impossible Mission Force) agent Ethan Hunt is fighting against forces much greater than himself (including his own government) to keep the world from imploding. We get a mix of familiar characters—Ving Rhames's computer hacker Luther Stickell, ever the voice of sturdy reason since the very first film (he is the only character besides Ethan to have appeared in every film in the series); Simon Pegg's technician and communications expert Benji Dunn, who has long since outgrown his initial role as comic relief into a reliable dramatic mainstay; and Rebecca Ferguson's supposed deceased spy/potential love interest Ilsa Faust. We also get the return of Vanessa Kirby's nefarious arms dealer The White Widow and the introduction of a new villain, the brutal Gabriel (Esai Morales), who has a tragic link back to Ethan's pre-IMF past. We also get a crucial new character in Grace (Hayley Atwell), a professional thief who is Ethan's antagonist, then his partner, then his antagonist again. The back-and-forth between the two has the pulse of a screwball comedy, but with the world at stake. They spend a great portion of the film handcuffed together while trying to escape a relentless assassin while tearing through the streets of Rome in a tiny yellow Fiat 500.

As with the previous two films, Dead Reckoning Part One builds and builds and builds, and at various points you think that the film might very well just burst, but it never does. Instead, McQuarrie keeps piling on scenes and plot twists and character revelations; there are fights, chases (including the perennial Tom Cruise running scene, this one on top of a mostly glass airport), and tons of techno-speak, which here is amplified by the centrality of Entity, which is able to take over virtually any communication system and use it to its advantage, including impersonating others and erasing people from video surveillance in real time. This forces the IMF team to go old-school analogue, which has a particularly satisfying resonance in the penultimate film in a series that has long prided itself on maintaining as many vestiges of old-school action pleasure it can afford.",yes
9,"Thanks to an infusion of dynamic new faces and the return of some franchise staples, Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One is making the inconceivable a reality. This series somehow keeps getting better with each installment.

It seemed like the series had nowhere left to go but down after the stellar Mission: Impossible -Fallout. Star Tom Cruise and director/co-screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie missed the text. They keep aiming to top the last installment and clearly have been up to the challenge.

mission-impossible-dead-reckoning-part-1-review-ethan-luther-and-benji

McQuarrie deserves a ton of credit for revitalizing the franchise without the need to continue playing director hot potato. With one director handling the last three installments, there's a more consistent sense of cohesion and continuity for the presentation. And it doesn't hurt that McQuarrie is in lockstep with Cruise's vision.

Dead Reckoning kicks off with a dramatic opening act involving a Russian sub and a daring Ethan Hunt (Cruise) mission before the opening credits. That's the tease that this is going to be the most action-packed, explosive installment yet.

Ethan is tasked with tracking down the key that can either control or destroy an insidious weapon — an evolving artificial intelligence that could send the world to ruin. As usual when he's faced with slim odds to complete a mission, Ethan assembles his team of Luther (Ving Rhames), Benji (Simon Pegg) and Ilsa (Rebecca Ferguson).

mission-impossible-dead-reckoning-part-1-review-benji-luther-ethan-and-ilsa

A staple of the first four films was the revolving team. McQuarrie opts to keep a core crew with the random addition. There's a certain comfort level of the knowing Luther, Benji and Ilsa will always be there to have Ethan's back. And they're not as astonished by his insane ideas. Still, it would be nice for some callbacks with some of the old IMF agents.

Dead Reckoning's new addition is Grace (Hayley Atwell, Avengers: Endgame), a thief who gets tangled into Ethan's efforts to track down the key's buyer. Ferguson has made for an amazing member of the team since her debut in 2015's M:I – Rogue Nation.

Ilsa proved just as capable of handling herself in a scrap like Ethan. Grace is a welcome addition to the Mission: Impossible universe as she's in over her head in the spy game world. She leans on her thief instincts and defaults into looking out for herself even as Ethan is trying to save her life. Atwell is superb here coming off like a megastar fully deserving of being the co-lead in Dead Reckoning.

In a fun casting choice, Atwell's Agent Carter co-star Shea Whigham is also part of the cast as Briggs, an agent determined to bring Hunt in. Briggs' partner, Degas (Cruise's Top Gun: Maverick co-star Greg Tarzan Davis), offers a welcome voice of reason as an agent who considers Ethan might have a reason for going against orders.

Having the team face an evil AI creates some interesting possibilities, but that can't top having a great villain. Smartly, McQuarrie and co-screenwriter Erik Jendresen work in a physical and calculating threat with Gabriel (Esai Morales, Titans). Gabriel and Ethan have a longstanding history, which might be enough to cause Ethan to jeopardize the mission.

Morales is a magnificent bastard, but he can't be everywhere at once. Enter Pom Klementieff (Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3) as Gabriel's right-hand woman, Paris.

Klementieff has been a scene stealer in the Guardians/Avengers films but she is a revelation here bringing major Bond femme fatale energy as the unhinged back-up.

Paris has such a cool presence and is easily one of the more memorable secondary villains in the entire franchise.

Vanessa Kirby is back as mover and shaker, The White Widow. The recurring characters definitely help make the McQuarrie-era feel like it's all part of one larger story.

The cinematography from Frances Taggart is gorgeous wonderfully showcasing the film's very diverse locales.

As impressive as the characters and the performances go, Mission: Impossible is still and action franchise. Dead Reckoning sets the bar at an impossibly higher level with multiple action sequences that would be a standard action film's best scene.

There's the riveting car chase sequence, the alley battle, the duels on the bridge, the train rooftop brawl and the great train escape. The final act delivers the most breathtaking action in the franchise.

mission-impossible-dead-reckoning-part-1-review-grace-and-ethan-holding-on

And as contractually obligated to state in every Mission: Impossible review, it's insane and commendable that Cruise is so committed to making the stunts look real that does them himself.

Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One seemed a bit ambitious with its lengthy run time and a cliffhanger ending. By the time the credits rolled, it's clear the franchise can go as long as Cruise and McQuarrie want it to at this point.",yes
10,"Mission: Impossible – Fallout was such a good movie and such a fine, logical conclusion to a movie series that went on for more than two decades, that why would we need any more? You guessed it: cold, hard cash. But Tom Cruise and his favorite writer/director Christopher McQuarrie have cooked up a solid new entry with plenty of astonishing set-pieces. It doesn't have much of a villain — its sentient AI is more of a lazy sci-fi device than anything resembling real life — and there aren't any new wrinkles to any of the characters (aside from real-life wrinkles). And it's certainly a bit too long, especially with the promise of a Part Two, for what the story promises. But, truth be told, it's just a lot of fun.

The good guys and bad guys are all after the two parts of a key, although no one knows what it unlocks (I guess we'll find out in Part Two). The first set-piece has Ethan (Cruise) and Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) fighting a bunch of gunmen in the desert. Ilsa appears to die. Then there's an attempted heist at Abu Dhabi Airport, involving Benji (Simon Pegg), Luther (Ving Rhames), a thief named Grace (Hayley Atwell), a baddie named Gabriel, and a nuclear device. Then there's a fantastic party in Venice, an amazing motorcycle jump, and then the piece-de-resistance, a train tumbling over the side of a broken bridge, one car at a time, while our heroes try to scramble up through each car to safety. The White Widow (Vanessa Kirby) returns, and Pom Klementieff plays an assassin.

Paramount released a beautiful two-disc Blu-ray set, with exceptional picture and sound (a Dolby Atmos audio track really roars). Bonuses include a McQuarrie commentary track and an isolated music track. The second disc includes six cool short behind-the-scenes featurettes detailing the stunts. The set also comes with a digital copy. This is Highly Recommended.",yes
11,"The Mission: Impossible film series has been pulling off a remarkable balancing act over the past 27 years: maintaining a devotion to state-of-the-art action film tech and procedure while maintaining the enduring hook of the 1960s TV series that gave the whole endeavor its distinguishing flourish — peerless mask-making skills. A full-on embrace of that corny cornerstone has allowed this series of films (seven so far, not including the forthcoming Dead Reckoning Part Two) to stay true to itself even as the nuts-and-bolts of espionage have shifted and superseded one another. Dead Reckoning's Big Bad, a superintelligent algorithm that has basically attained sentience, would have felt more like Ghost in the Shell than Mission: Impossible back when the first film came out in 1996. But producer/star/stuntperson Tom Cruise has made a point of keeping things relatable, if not completely relevant.

We start out in a tense submarine sequence that puts the viewer through an emotional wringer before giving us a visceral shock and a surreal image equally poetic and horrifying — things kick off with the kind of visceral cold open that sets up everything that follows in the way that yields liminal dread whenever you stop and piece it all together. And before you know it, there's a desert siege and a government infiltration (including a look that can only be described as Rami Malek cosplaying as Ray Wise, or vice versa), and all that is before we even get the opening credits.

Occasionally, we get some low-key metatextual banter in the dialogue. But the strength of the script (by director Christopher McQuarrie and Erik Jendresen) is in the way the menace of rampaging AI mirrors the absolute chaos and salt-sown scorched earth that AI and CEOs seeking tax write-downs have recently wrought on writers and all manner of creative artists.

These movies are literally and figuratively chasing the peak of 2011's Ghost Protocol, when Cruise climbed the side of the Burj Khalifa in Dubai in 70 mm IMAX. That sustained sequence did a better job of demonstrating the power that movies have in creating suspension of disbelief — both in the way that audiences felt sincere, empathic terror for a multimillionaire movie star who genuinely seemed like he might die before our eyes, as well as an irrational and vertiginous dread that felt like somehow (shades of Nightmare on Elm Street 4) gravity was going to pull the actual audience out of our seats and into certain doom on the screen. The latter feeling has been minimized in the intervening years, but Cruise has found a way to explore his own tempting of fate and turn it into a marketing hook that keeps everyone focused on exactly how he is raging against the passage of time. But in the way that Dead Reckoning Part One avoids that brick wall of enthusiasm that hit this summer's Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse at its end by being very upfront that this is but Part One in the opening credits, it still means that we're not getting quite the full experience. So we get action and chaos and reversals and deaths and rebirths, but there's a tenuous vibe to everything, because we're not going to know how it all fits together until we get through Part Two.

At times, it feels like things are going to go full-on sci-fi/horror. The rampaging AI whatsit (referred to ominously as ""The Entity"") is genuinely scary, both in what it is capable of and in the way its emissary Gabriel (a magnificent Esai Morales) syncs with its vast and uncontrollable knowledge, adding a facet to the big confrontations that we've never seen before in this kind of film. It is impossible to overpraise Morales in this film — adding a kind of exquisite menace steeped in both Mentat (from Dune) and Vermillion (from Legion) vibes. While we all love Nicolas Hoult (who was originally supposed to play the role), it's difficult to imagine him bringing the same sort of salt-and-pepper imperiousness to the part, and it's how Gabriel fits into Part Two that's asking the big questions in this epic. There are several instances of wordless flashbacks to decades ago that seem ill at ease in the visual language of the series up to this point, and there are edits that seem to call unnecessary attention to themselves.

There are four different women characters in play. Returning are badass Ilsa (Rebecca Ferguson) and arms dealer/fashionista The White Widow (Vanessa Kirby). Newcomers are international thief Grace (Hayley Atwell) and Bond-villian-style chaos agent Paris (Pom Klementieff). They all have different things to do, but Klementieff and Atwell get a rip-roaring Italian cobblestone chase involving a Fiat and an urban assault vehicle that can't help but be the highlight of Part One, and I say that as someone who is in the bag for any kind of train-based scam-adjacent chase — and this film has a stellar third-act 90-degree chase through train cars.

After a summer of perfectly fine films being openly rejected by audiences, it's hard to say exactly how crowds are going to respond to this one. Dead Reckoning delivers most of everything that series fans could want, though it's still only half a film. So all bets are technically off, even though this is stuffed to the gills with all manner of escapist action set pieces.",yes
12,"This seventh outing for Tom Cruise and gang finds Cruise's Ethan Hunt on a new deadly mission to track down a set of keys capable of shutting down a weapon that could ultimately destroy mankind. Sounds like the plot of all the other films also, I know. But while the stories of all the films sound roughly the same, one after another, they keep pumping out big fresh action films, and this one is a really fun firecracker. Returning after his MI debut film with Fallout, is action-adventure director extraordinaire Christopher McQuarrie who just does a bang up job with both the writing and directing. Keeping you on your toes when you feel like you know most of the tricks is a hard task, and he is so good at it. What he is also good at is adding a big dose of humor, making the film that much more enjoyable. While I still don't care much for the person Tom Cruise, there is no doubt that the movie star Tom Cruise has one heck of a screen presence and he truly puts his all into the picture. I can at least admire that. He's always been known to do his own stunt work and the stunts keep getting bigger and bigger, culminating in a sequence like here that looks truly death-defying. But when studios make such a big deal about stuff like that, I always worry that the stunt is there to serve itself and not the story. But here the flying motorcycle scene works perfectly, and its context is not in the least misappropriated. Very clearly laying out that this is a part one, the film doesn't leave you hanging too terribly bad. You know there is business left to finish, but you don't feel cheated. Instead you leave the theater worn out from having a great summer movie take you for one hell of a ride. ",yes
13,"After watching ""Mission: Impossible II"" (2000) in theaters soon after its release date of May 24, 2000, I decided not to see anymore then promised to return once the franchise was on its last film. Time to pay the piper and (re)watch the existing entire franchise, seven movies, before ""Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning"" (2025) is released on May 23, 2025 (or more specifically before my screening on Wednesday, May 21, 2025. First, ""A Minecraft Movie"" (2025) and now this! What I do for the love of the game! I'm probably the only person not into this franchise.

""Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One"" (2023) is the seventh of eight movies that reboot the television series. An AI called the Entity can shape digital reality. Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) accepts a mission to retrieve the key that controls it but decides to immediately go rogue because if he obeys his orders, then the world will still be at risk. Can Ethan save the world without anyone losing their life?

Are you familiar with the idiom apples to oranges to explain that two things are so fundamentally different that they cannot be compared? Cruise is like that. Cruise from ""Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One"" hits apples hotness to his former orange hotness from ""Mission: Impossible II."" He is like two different people with nothing in common. In the latter, he is an adventurer, young buck, movie star. Here, Cruise gives tailored fitness with his grey pants and vest with white shirt and wearing wire rimmed glasses. He would fit right in working at the high school in Sunnydale, California and watching over Slayers, and that is a compliment of the highest order. He is coming for Kingsman Colin Firth's neck, and I'm here for it. Short hair hotness unlocked without looking boyish. Yes, please. If he serves these looks in the next movie, which seems unlikely given the posters, then terrific. The stunts are outstanding, natch. Cruise is keeping it high and tight! Ok, zaddy, we see you.

It is also a relief that after ""Mission: Impossible – Fallout,"" ""Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One"" mostly departs from the formula of prior installments. It feels like a reboot within a reboot along with being a sequel. There is a prequel embedded in this story about how Ethan became an Impossible Missions Force (""IMF"") agent. It feels a bit like revisionist history.  This development departs from the television series mythos and the implied recruitment/training established in prior movies. Think ""Nikita."" Benji (Simon Pegg) went to Oxford, and others seemed straightlaced, but who knows. Anyone can run afoul of the law, become a recruit and get a second chance at life. It feels like the movies are building IMF as it goes, but whatever. The team includes the aforementioned Benji, who is less annoying this time around though just as insensitive to anyone else besides his feelings of overwhelm. Still, he is mostly effective here. Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) is also back but leaves abruptly to work out the problem so maybe he will have a larger role in the final movie. Luther has a great scene where he is calmly toggling between helping Benji and Ethan while they are in the field. He still functions as the moral center of the group. Ilsa (Rebecca Ferguson) is back saving lives and being a badass, but do not get excited. Ferguson is amazing but apparently there can only be so many women in a ""Mission: Impossible"" movie, which is fine because her talents are wasted here. Still no Brandt (Jeremy Renner), but Renner's absence is not keenly missed this time. He would not fit in this story.

Grace (Hayley Atwell) winds up spending the most time with Ethan in the field. She is a thief tasked with retrieving the key for her unknown employer. Grace and Ethan's dynamic is playful. She understandably does not trust this man who barged into her life and telling her what to do. Grace becomes an unofficial barometer of Ethan's goodness. The pair are like dance partners. It is no surprise that Atwell would fit into this franchise easily. She was a strong part of the MCU as Agent Peggy Carter, and it is great to see her in a role worthy of her talents. No sexualization or ogling here.  She is as buttoned up as Ethan so no excuse to flash her gams to the camera, and it is a nice break.

Despite having the second longest runtime in the franchise, ""Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One"" feels like a lighter and fresher movie. One staple never changes: the compulsory overrated, overused trope of the protagonist as top suspect, but I'm signing a waiver from my eternal disgust because it makes sense why Ethan would choose to be rogue given the threat. If anyone gets the key to the Entity, including the US government, digital reality would be unreliable forever, which is completely fictional, right? Right.  So, the count rises to four to five ""Mission: Impossible"" movies feature Ethan as a rogue agent, but I'm not mad.

Who can blame Ethan for going rogue when the IMF Director is still Eugene Kittredge (Henry Czarny), who was originally introduced in ""Mission: Impossible"" (1996). Damn, dude stays in the job. CIA Director Erika Sloane (Angela Bassett) sits out this movie, but her photo is on the wall in one scene so maybe she is the President of the United States of America. Guess that we'll get confirmation in the next movie. Kittredge works with the Director of National Intelligence Denlinger (Cary Elwes). They order a manhunt, which Agent Jasper Briggs (Shea Whigham, one of the great character actors) and his partner, Agent Theo Degas (Greg Tarzan Davis), run abroad. For reasons unstated, Briggs has a grudge against Ethan, but Degas has a begrudging respect for him. Their dynamic is genuinely enjoyable, and I'm psyched to see how they navigate the last movie. I've never been into Czarny's performance, and Elwes is forgettable.

There is a flashback glimpse of Ethan's nemesis before he joined the IMF, which introduces audiences to the new bad guy, who is the Entity's familiar, Gabriel (Esai Morales). Nicholas Hoult was supposed to play Gabriel, and while I adore Hoult, it is so nice to see Morales in a movie blockbuster role. Morales is innately likeable, so it feels especially dissonant to see Gabriel wear white and be so irredeemable. Gabriel is officially my third favorite villain, which puts Morales behind Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Michael Nyqvist, but ahead of Jon Voight and Sean Harris. Honestly depending on how he performs in the last movie, he could edge out Nyqvist. He has two henchmen, but the only one worth talking about is the unhinged assassin Paris (Pom Klementieff). Daryl Hannah in ""Blade Runner"" seems to inspire Klementieff's performance. You may be familiar with her because she plays Mantis in the MCU, specifically the ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" branch.

""Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One"" is not perfect. They took the White Widow, aka Alana (Vanessa Kirby), my favorite character in ""Mission: Impossible – Fallout,"" and decided to explore the question, ""What if she sucked?"" They took a competent, controlled mover and shaker and made her seem like a legacy baby unworthy to head the family business that Max Mitsopolis (Vanessa Redgrave), who was my favorite character in ""Mission: Impossible,"" founded. It is not Kirby's fault, who does her best with what she was given, but it was hella disappointing. 

Even though ""Mission: Impossible – Fallout"" came out the same year as ""John Wick: Chapter 4"" (2023), it felt as if it took a page from its book instead of vice versa. There is a ""Laurence of Arabia"" -esque sequence, but once again, Keanu Reeves' film dog walks them. In this film, it ranges from homage to imitation, but in ""Chapter 4,"" it feels like a transcendent resurrection. It is a stunning movie. There are a lot of sequences that feel like other movies: ""The Hunt for Red October"" (1990), ""The Heat"" (2013) and any number of movies involving espionage in airports and trains.  The denouement felt like a cool reinvention of ""The Poseidon Adventure"" (1972) and other Seventies disaster survival films, which were always fun.

""Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol"" (2011) remains the gold standard after watching seven of the eight movies. The rest of the ranking is ""Mission: Impossible II,"" ""Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One,"" ""Mission: Impossible III"" (2006), ""Mission: Impossible – Fallout,"" ""Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation"" (2015) and ""Mission: Impossible.""  The seventh film could have trimmed some prose dumping fat to make a shorter runtime and done a better job with the supporting characters, but overall, it is a strong movie deserving of its accolades.  Favorite Cruise films for context (not in a particular order or an exhaustive list): ""Interview with the Vampire"" (1994), ""Magnolia"" (1999), ""Collateral"" (2004) and the aforementioned ""Edge of Tomorrow"" (2014). To be fair, I tend to stay away from spending money on anyone who owns an island (among other reasons), but he is entertaining. Also, a bonus is he cares about everyone's health so while normally I would not want an actor in the government again, maybe make him the Secretary of Health and Human Services because he would get us vaccines or at least follow Covid-19 protocols with masking and isolating. I'm looking forward to the last movie, but since strong ""Mission: Impossible"" films are normally followed up with weaker ones, I'm going to try and lower my expectations.",yes
14,"Almost three decades after Tom Cruise revitalized the ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise, the seventh installment in the series arrives in theaters filled with incredible stunts, chase scenes, hand-to-hand combat, and of course several shots of our protagonist running, and running, and running. Clocking in at 163 minutes, ""MI7"" sees the rogue IMF team at the genesis of what could merge into the ""Terminator"" series as Artificial Intelligence plays a ""key"" role in the spy thriller. Esai Morales gives us a series-best villain, audience favorite Ving Rhames reprises his Luther role.

The film opens with shades of ""The Hunt for Red October"" aboard a Russian submarine that houses the story's A.I. antagonist known as the Entity. Tense moments lead to dire consequences in the kind of prologue usually seen in a 007 film right before Adele, Bassey, or Eilish begin singing the latest theme song. But this isn't that type of film. Ethan Hunt (Cruise) is more blue-collar, unlike his white-collar British counterpart. When Lalo Schifrin's iconic instrumental theme (""Burning Fuse"") kicks in it's the equivalent of taking a flight, ""Fasten your seatbelts and get ready for takeoff.""

The plot of ""Dead Reckoning, Part One"" involves Hunt and his Impossible Mission Force in a race against time to recover two halves of a key that will shut down the Entity. The digital antagonist is aided by a terrorist named Gabriel played by veteran actor Esai Morales who's been giving us terrific performances since he appeared opposite Sean Penn in ""Bad Boys"" forty years ago. In most cases, Gabriel would be an eccentric baddie using the A.I. to take over the world. Here, Morales is suave, sophisticated, and menacing, acting as the foot soldier to the Entity in a bit of role reversal.

Czerny's return as CIA director and former IMF leader Eugene Kittridge, and Cruise on top of another runaway train during the film's climax, hints the series has come full circle. In 1996's ""MI1,"" Hunt chases down original IMF leader Jim Phelps (Jon Voight) on the roof of a moving bullet train. In the latest installment, Hunt battles Gabriel on the roof of a fast-moving train, but there's a big difference. The first film's train sequence was shot on a soundstage at Pinewood Studios with CGI, a wind machine, and two life-size train cars helping to create the illusion. In ""Dead Reckoning, Part One"" you get to witness Cruise and Morales on top of a real train constructed just for the film moving through the mountains at 60 mph. It's an exhilarating sequence and one of the most expensive practical effects ever created.

The film was written by director Christopher McQuarrie and screenwriter Erik Jendresen. Both men have been working with Cruise on a future project that will bring the actor back to more adult-themed, R-rated material. McQuarrie has been collaborating with Cruise since 2008's ""Valkyrie"" making ""Dead Reckoning, Part One"" and its sequel, the third and fourth ""Mission: Impossible"" films after helming ""Rogue Nation"" and ""Fallout."" Cruise and McQuarrie make a perfect team, just like DiCaprio and Scorsese, because they share the same vision, and it shows in the quality of their work. McQuarrie was brought in by Cruise to rework the ""Ghost Protocol"" script. He tightened it up, but the studio decided not to use his ending. It's unfortunate but the silver lining turned out to be McQuarrie taking over the franchise as director.

Apart from Rhames as skilled hacker Luther and Czerny as Kittridge, returning cast members include Simon Pegg as loyal IMF team member Benji (more latex masks!) who's been with the franchise since ""Mission: Impossible III."" Rebecca Ferguson is back, sporting an eyepatch as disavowed MI6 agent and IMF ally Ilsa Faust, who appeared in 2015's ""Rogue Nation"" and 2018's ""Fallout,"" and Vanessa Kirby returns as arms-dealing Alanna Mitsopolis, aka White Widow, who also appeared in ""Fallout."" There's a scene with Alanna and Kittridge that also feels like a ""full-circle moment"" as Czerny appeared opposite Vanessa Redgrave who played arms dealer Max, the mother of Alanna, in the first film back in 1996.

Newcomers on this go-round include Haley Atwell as petty thief and sophisticated pickpocket Grace. She's a charming and cunning criminal looking to up her game and paycheck. Despite being a major hindrance for Hunt, her skills don't go unnoticed by the IMF leader who views her as a possible recruit for the rogue organization. Atwell and Cruise have real chemistry, together they deliver some of the film's funniest moments. Humor has always been a large part of the franchise's success, in ""MI7"" there are several funny standout scenes including Cruise and Atwell in a tiny yellow Fiat 500 being chased through the streets of Rome. The all-electric vintage car was built to get up and go specifically for the film — the average Fiat 500 moves considerably slower — and for anime fans, it feels like a tribute to Lupin III, specifically the 1979 film ""The Castle of Cagliostro"" which featured the master thief protagonist in a yellow Fiat 500. The film marked the directorial debut of Hayao Miyazaki, the beloved Japanese animator, filmmaker, and manga artist who co-founded Studio Ghibli.

The A.I.-themed ""Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning, Part One"" is well-timed as Artificial Intelligence makes the news daily. In the Houston Film Critics Society, we give out an annual award for the Best Stunt Team Coordination recognizing the efforts of those brave men and women who make going to the movies a thrilling adventure. The inaugural award was given to legendary stuntman and filmmaker Hal Needham whose wife Ellyn accepted the award on behalf of her late husband. I'm thinking we need a special award for Tom Cruise who continues to astonish audiences with his death-defying stunts. You've seen him drive a motorcycle off a cliff in the trailer for ""MI7,"" wait until you see the entire sequence in the film. It's amazing.

At almost three hours, the film is a tad long, but it never lags as McQuarrie and Cruise keep the audience entertained for every one of those 163 minutes. As expected, ""Dead Reckoning, Part One"" ends unresolved, we'll have to wait until ""Part Two"" opens in June 2024 for the finale, but until then a return trip to the theater for a second viewing is on my agenda and just recently all the ""Mission: Impossible"" films were released in 4K Blu Ray including a 6-movie collection set for more ""Mission: Impossible"" at home. ",yes
15,"For me the Mission: Impossible movies have become the epitome of Hollywood blockbusters done right. Tom Cruise has taken the series from its early days of experimenting with different directors and their different styles to its more cohesive current state as a consistently jaw-dropping action franchise that has thrived under the winning watchful eye of writer-director Christopher McQuarrie.

As most know, the Mission: Impossible films are famous for steadily upping the ante in terms of mind-blowing action set pieces that repeatedly push the boundaries of practical effects and stunt work. And of course leading that charge is Tom Cruise himself whose passion for giving audiences truly memorable big screen experiences has led to him constantly one-upping himself in terms of wild death-defying stunts.

The seventh installment in the franchise is finally here and it once again delivers exactly the kind of big-budget cinematic thrills that I've come to expect. ""Dead Reckoning Part One"" is the first of an epic two-parter with its direct sequel set to release June 28, 2024. McQuarrie returns to helm the massive project and the cast is overflowing with fan favorite characters and some really intriguing new ones. But once again it's Cruise who is the linchpin both on screen and off.

Cruise reprises his role as IMF agent Ethan Hunt who this time finds himself on an unsanctioned mission to hunt down a sentient A.I. called the Entity (how timely) that has gone rogue. Different governments around the world want to harness and weaponize the Entity, but Ethan believes it to be too dangerous to control and sets out to destroy it. That puts him odds with the world's intelligence agencies including his own.

The hunt begins with the search for a key that's said to unlock the ability to control the Entity. The key is broken into two pieces, one believed to be in the possession of Ilsa Faust (the superb Rebecca Ferguson), an ex-MI6 agent and close ally to Ethan. IMF director Eugene Kittridge (Henry Czerny making his first appearance since the 1996 original film) has put a bounty on Ilsa's head yet tips off Ethan to her whereabouts.

The other part of the key is tracked to Abu Dhabi International Airport where Ethan is joined by his loyal friends and team members Benji (Simon Pegg) and Luther (Ving Rhames). But they aren't the only ones trying to retrieve it. A mysterious face from Ethan's past named Gabriel (Esai Morales) is working for the Entity and is determined to get to the key first. Meanwhile an intelligence collective called The Community has sent a force led by Jasper Briggs (Shea Whigham) to secure Ethan dead or alive.

The wild card in the story is also the film's best new addition. Hayley Atwell plays Grace, a smart and resourceful professional thief with (as Atwell herself described them) rather ambiguous loyalties. She snatches the key in the airport but soon finds herself in way over her head. Atwell has an infectious charm and her chemistry with Cruise fuels some of the movie's best scenes.

As the story unfolds McQuarrie and company take us all around the world, making stops in Amsterdam, the Bering Sea, the Arabian Desert, Washington DC, Abu Dahbi, Rome, Venice, and the Austrian Alps. They're all beautifully shot by DP Fraser Taggart. McQuarrie utilizes the numerous locations incredibly well resulting in a number of strikingly unique yet equally thrilling action scenes that pop off the screen.

The story itself is compelling yet clearly building towards a proper conclusion which we should get in Part Two. Still it's energized by the committed and often nuanced performances from a truly spot-on cast. Cruise, Ferguson, Rhames, and Pegg have a well-established chemistry which once again forms the centerpiece of the story. I've mentioned how great Atwell is. The same can be said for Morales who makes for a formidable antagonist who remains somewhat of a mystery even after the credits roll. Vanessa Kirby returns as the always fascinating White Widow while Pom Klementieff adds a cool maniacal twist.

It doesn't have many, but there are a few shortcomings. For example, Ethan and Gabriel's past certainly has a role to play in the film. Yet it doesn't get the attention it needs to feel meaningful. Also as an unapologetic fan of Ferguson's Ilsa, I really wish she had been given more to do. There's a lengthy stretch in the first half where she's nowhere to be found and then just pops up with no explanation. Same with Rhames in the third act.

But let's be real, those are minor quibbles especially for a movie that delivers the kind of exhilarating entertainment we get from ""Dead Reckoning Part One"". Cruise and McQuarrie have once again collaborated to make a poster boy summer blockbuster that lovingly embraces what makes the big screen experience so uniquely special. It's kinetically paced and action driven, yet anchored by great characters and with more than a few laughs to break up the tension. Altogether it makes for a wonderful first part to what could be a truly unforgettable mission. ""Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One"" is in theaters now.",yes
16,"His is an impossible mission–to save movie theaters, once again, but Tom Cruise will always choose to accept it.

If last summer's Top Gun Maverick made a case for Cruise as the gold standard of modern movie stars, its head-spinning global success propelled by the promise of watching the actor soar higher and faster than anyone before or after him, the latest installment in his death-defying Mission: Impossible franchise seeks to build upon that momentum by all but officially top-billing Cruise as Hollywood's last man standing (and sprinting, flying, speed-racing, and riding a motorbike off the edge of a cliff).

With his megawatt smile and trademark dedication to doing his own stunts, no matter the cost, Cruise is an assuredly rare breed, one of the few working professionals whose bankability and unassailable personal brand still go hand-in-hand, and whose commitment to releasing movies in theaters is only rivaled by his near-fanatical devotion to making movies viscerally awe-inspiring enough to sanctify the big-screen experience for a new generation.

With film studios crashing and burning at the box office with one empty occupation of IP after another, there's something undeniably cinematic about Cruise's authentic commitment to his craft and the breathtaking thrill of watching him hang from the side of a plane or scale the Burj Khalifa. And he knows it. To hear it from the actor himself, via audio leaked from M:I's set after crew members flouted COVID-19 safety regulations, ""That's what I sleep with every night — the future of this fucking industry!""

And so it makes sense in his exhilarating Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One that Cruise's opponent is an actual algorithm, a sentient viral intelligence called ""The Entity"" that's capable of controlling and manipulating the truth as soon as it exits reality and enters a digital realm. Nothing that passes through a computer screen can be counted upon, in other words. The only solution is to figure out where the AI's source code is housed and manually pull its plug, ideally before it makes use of all the military weapons systems and intelligent networks it's hacked into. (Not since Sex Tape has so much dialogue been dedicated to our distrust of the omnipresent Cloud.) Hitting theaters after years in development and various pandemic-related delays, Dead Reckoning is strikingly well-timed in its affirmation of in-camera stuntwork and real locations as Hollywood's only counter to, and defense against, AI-assisted annihilation.

Luckily, for the future of humankind, its most practically minded super-spy is on the case, having already received his mission the old-fashioned way–via self-destructing cassette, naturally–and accepted it without hesitation. In IMF agent Ethan Hunt, Cruise has found a hero who can embody his fabled willpower, a perpetual running man whose races against time and frequent face-offs with the laws of physics carry literal, existential stakes; if his fuse burns down, if he fails to stop the clock or beat the odds, the ensuing explosion will be of the world-ending variety. Although cutting-edge AI's increased presence in the plot brings Mission: Impossible toward a more speculative resonance, much else remains the same in this reliably slick seventh entry in the franchise, now far and away Hollywood's most well-oiled blockbuster machine.

Skillfully shifting between exotic locales and orchestrating one impressive action sequence after another, the film surrounds the actor with an ever-expanding array of elegant, ass-kicking women (franchise faithful Rebecca Ferguson, plus Hayley Atwell, Vanessa Kirby, and Pom Klementieff), techie sidekicks (Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames), and clandestine ne'er-do-wells (Esai Morales, Henry Czerny, and Cary Elwes). And it precisely calculates a ratio of dramatic twists to familiar thrills that infuses the proceedings with a real sense of consequence, one absent from Mission: Impossible's devil-may-care early installments but that complements Cruise's recent on-screen confrontations with his own mortality, and the specter of a future he might not be able to outrun.

Credit returning co-writer and director Christopher McQuarrie, over a decade into his creative collaboration with Cruise and on his third film in the series, with keeping all of these players in motion, and moving at the breakneck pace required by such a breathless undertaking. If the tone and feel of earlier Mission: Impossible entries flowed from their filmmakers' established styles — Brian de Palma's twisted Hitchcockian suspense, John Woo's gloriously stylized action, Brad Bird's cartoonish action-comedy — McQuarrie's lasting contribution is a style of intensely pressurized efficiency. His films push the Mission: Impossible franchise away from espionage melodrama and toward a spectacle of function, of situation and action over emotion and impact; each bravura sequence doubles as a celebration of the derring-do involved in its making, most of all a legitimately heart-pounding scene in which Cruise — not a stuntman, as befits his mantle as the greatest showman — rides a motorcycle off a cliff and turns its descent into a base-jump, in one flawlessly executed shot.

Dead Reckoning Part One adds as well a climactic trainwreck sequence and a handcuffed chase across Rome in a tiny yellow Fiat, both of which amplify Cruise's physicality to near-comic proportions and position him alongside such fleet-footed virtuoso performers as Jackie Chan and Buster Keaton. Amid all the swiftly moving commotion, and the steady whirring of plot mechanics audible within it, Cruise delivers another performance built to exaggerate his enduring stamina and sense of superhuman determination. Even so, he finds humanity in this action avatar and manages to offset Ethan's deadly-serious purpose with self-deprecating wit and a puckish, knowing foolhardiness.

In this respect, the film's stacked supporting cast is among its essential assets, providing Ethan with a revolving door of allies and enemies who willingly cede the spotlight to his unparalleled bouts of high-octane athleticism without entirely vanishing from view, and who represent the kind of collateral damage that Ethan cannot sanction. As quick-fingered pickpocket Grace, Atwell supplies the easy, free-flowing charisma and mock incredulity of a future franchise lead; Ferguson's Ilsa Faust, introduced back in Rogue Nation, gets slightly less to do in this installment, but the actress brings to her interactions with Cruise a wearied recognition and, within that, the sense of a meeting of equals.

The best performances come, however, from Kirby as the glamorous, scene-stealing arms dealer Alanna Mitsopolis, whose unnervingly diamond-hard facial expressions can flicker moment-to-moment between mischief and menace, and Klementieff, whose ludicrously costumed and mostly silent assassin is the type of adversary so wonderfully outsized she can throw even a spy as seasoned as Ethan off his game.

Perhaps one result of Cruise's evident compulsion to up the stakes dramatically with each installment is that Dead Reckoning feels like the most self-conscious of the Mission: Impossible films, both in its stylistic homages to earlier entries (such as De Palma's intense close-ups and canted angles) and in its hat-tips to classics as wide-reaching as The Hunt for Red October (a clever prologue on a Russian submarine) and Battleship Potemkin (a riff on its Odessa steps). That the film concludes with a cliffhanger — albeit one more satisfyingly full-circle than those seen in other recent Part One blockbusters — adds to the sense of a franchise taking the long view of its legacy and pulling out all the stops in preparation for next year's supposed grand finale.

After all, the tension of these films has never been dependent upon the outcome of Ethan's mission, instead building as the odds of this character's success dwindle and his bouts of bravura showmanship offer palpable, flesh-and-blood reasons to keep the faith. It's a sensible equation to split in half, and Dead Reckoning Part One delivers its spectacle smartly, without shortcuts. The series serves now to set a continually high bar for craft in Hollywood filmmaking, holding out against the remainder of the industry's audience-alienating digital detritus, restoring a certain level of trust in the potential of the blockbuster to push limits and earn your admiration.",yes
17,"It's interesting to me how Cruise's latest blockbuster, Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part 1, ends with various action sequences on a runaway train, as the Lumiere Brothers' 1896 short The Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat Station, which was a sensation when it screened over a century ago, is entirely of a train operating as it should. The spectacle in that film was both in the composition of the shot - which created the feeling of an actual train coming at the screen and the audience - and in the unexpected and surprising elements inherent in this new-fangled format of lights and chemicals. 

Things aren't so simple now, as movies like Dead Reckoning Part 1 have massive production design, choreography, and stunts upon stunts being performed, all to grab attention and create awe. But the interesting thing that connects Cruise's masterstroke of a film to the beginning days of cinema, in my mind, is not in the illusion of ""reality"" coming at you, but in the celebration of the reality that is happening before everyone.

On a deeper level, the story in Dead Reckoning Part 1 uses what's real and what's a trick as a weapon on the senses of its protagonist, the ever-noble Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise), who has taken it upon himself to save the world again and again, with little to no accountability, much like Captain America in the MCU's Civil War flick. In this film, Hunt is out to destroy ""The Entity,"" which is described as a radical and possibly sentient Artificial Intelligence program gone rogue. While this Entity doesn't go full MCU Age of Ultron (yet), it does use puzzles and past enemies to mess with Hunt's head, forcing him to question his actions and strategies. It's always learning and constantly computing all sorts of potentialities, in a grand effort to… we're not sure (yet).

What I am sure of is that Dead Reckoning Part 1 is a crowd-pleaser and then some. Just before the feature began, a moviegoer in my audience, seated in the front row, exclaimed, ""I've been waiting a year for this!"" to all that could hear. Whatever the box office results will determine, this mission, to pull the theatrical experience of cinema back from the edge of death, is an amazing hat trick that combines the tangible with the abstract. Alchemy? Almost. ",yes
18,"Few things have been as improbable as Christopher McQuarrie's ascension from independent screenwriter to world-class action director. ""Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One"" earns every vowel, consonant, and syllable of its long title, with sleight of hand sequences that make ""Now You See Me"" and its sequels look paltry, bombastic action setpieces that enthrall and excite, and for the first time in at least a decade we see Tom Cruise have sexual chemistry with a romantic lead. McQuarrie's globe-trotting ""Part One"" isn't his or the series' best, but it's maximalist in both its sensibility and appeal, putting one of our last movie stars in even more obscene and outlandish situations than before, not unlike the ""Fast and the Furious"" franchise though these films do have just ever so slightly more believability.

Though the film is mired in exposition rooted in its Artificial Intelligence MacGuffin it manages to generally do most of its explaining while you're able to think or focus on something else interesting, exciting, or enticing in the film, there is after all a lot going on. With Vanessa Kirby and Rebecca Ferguson reprising their roles of The White Widow and Ilsa from ""Mission: Impossible Fallout,"" the continuity between films in the series and the world our IMF agent and his closest associates populate seems to be nearly as established as its ever been. In a clumsy callback, they introduce/bring back a villain from De Palma's inaugural film, ""Mission: Impossible"" to be the head stooge for Hunt (Tom Cruise) to contend with as he pursues a key that may save the world from annihilation, if only Hunt knew where the key was supposed to go and what it was supposed to do.

Joining our rogue team of IMF, underworld operatives, and counter-intelligence ops group is Hayley Atwells Grace, practically steaming with charisma and nonchalant aptitude for just about every sequence she's in–climbing on a moving train near the end is the rare exception–Grace is a welcome addition to the formula McQuarrie has refined so aptly. He grounds the film by making it nearly as much about her as it is Hunt and his quest for redemption, with nifty asides employing the best qualities of Simon Pegg's Benji and Ving Rhames's Luther via high-stakes slapstick wholly contained within the larger operations they run during the mission. With a particularly charming and ludicrous bomb-disarming sequence performed by Simon Pegg.

The ""Mission: Impossible"" films under McQuarrie's tutelage have primarily upped the ante on physical feats, with ""Dead Reckoning Part One's"" motorcycle parachute onto a train sequence genuinely feeling like the true zenith of what our aged movie star can pull off now that he's two decades past 40. McQuarrie's screenplay and style for the film despite their setting and circumstance aren't that far from the films of the silent era stars Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin. Keaton notably had shot what at one point was the most expensive stunt in cinema, when he crashed a train into a river in ""The General,"" something McQuarrie and co. similarly, explore in this entry. Cruise skating by the skin of his teeth, and narrowly escaping would-be captors and death dealers alike, feels more like a Chaplin boxing match than any boringly grounded contemporary superhero feat. 

There's an effusive charm that underlies Cruise's Hunt and the film itself, and it seems McQuarrie is the common thread in this development for the series. It's interesting to contemplate ""Dead Reckoning Part One"" being just McQuarrie's fifth outing as a director–his fourth since joining with Cruise on 2012's ""Jack Reacher""– though his screenplay operates in a fairly straightforward fashion his sleight of hand and effervescence as a director is as apt as anyone in the industry. ""Dead Reckoning Part One"" isn't the best magic trick you've ever seen, but damn if it isn't one of the funnest.",yes
19,"It was going so well. Summer 2023 had gotten off to an auspicious start at the multiplex, give or take a silly ""Transformers"" movie. To date, we've had a couple of enjoyable superhero movies (hello, Miles Morales and Barry Allen), a star-studded gem from a renowned auteur (""Asteroid City,"" aka Wes Anderson's live-action Max Fleischer cartoon) and even a sweet, character-driven comedy inaccurately marketed as a sex farce (the Jennifer Lawrence vehicle ""No Hard Feelings,"" better than you'd expect).

But, almost like clockwork, along come a pair of plus-sized sequels to ruin the fun. One is being sold as the first half of a two-part espionage yarn, while the other is billed as a franchise capper that brings back a beloved icon from a simpler age of summer moviegoing, then adds a dollop of fan service. In both cases, creaky plotting, too many characters and poor creative decisions take these releases to the point of no return. At 163 and 154 minutes respectively, the key word is exhausting, something also reflected in their kilometric titles. Let's take a closer look. For old times' sake.

""Mission: Impossible -- Dead Reckoning Part One"": Look, it's Tom Cruise running as if his life depended on it! No, wait, now he's outracing baddies and the po-po down narrow streets and tourist-filled plazas. Hold that thought, he's infiltrating a government building where he's not supposed to be. What's that? He's playing cat-and-mouse footsie with Uncle Sam's best and brightest inside an international airport? Naw, get outta here, is he really getting frisky with a woman who has her own agenda?

Scratch that last part. No one is having sex in the ""Mission: Impossible"" movies anymore. Daredevil secret agent Ethan Hunt is no James Bond, after all, even though one senses part of him wishes he had 007's game.

Cruise's latest slice of intercontinental intrigue, his seventh as Hunt, will have you experiencing déjà vu all over again, not only because it trots out the oft-filmed scenarios described above, but because the star stopped doing the very thing that kept the ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise on its toes. Each of the first four films was helmed by a different director, with number four, the exhilarating ""Ghost Protocol,"" still standing tall as the strongest entry. But starting with 2015's ""Rogue Nation"" (reviewed in this very site by yours truly), Cruise has stuck with filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie (""The Way of the Gun"").

And the wear-and-tear on this creative partnership is really starting to show. ""Dead Reckoning Part One"" is the pair's third ""M:I"" entry together. A couple of things may be different. For instance, this is reportedly the first film in the franchise completely shot with digital cameras. (The change in format is noticeable during some exterior night shots and an endlessly hyped motorcycle stunt.) Mostly, though, everything looks and feels the same.

The threat this time is harder to pin down: a scheming and manipulative AI, linked to a Russian submarine, that might just unleash chaos worldwide if it falls into the wrong hands. An antagonist that cannot be touched or physically vanquished appears to be a challenge tailor-made for a franchise that fashions itself the thinking moviegoer's action spectacle. Unfortunately, it amounts to little more than narrative Scotch tape linking a series of elaborate setpieces together.

And make no mistake: the action is competently staged. Hunt and his team (Rebecca Ferguson, Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames are among the returning familiar faces) dodge bullets, hack their way to a solution and figure out confounding riddles in the nick of time like the pros they are. An extended chase sequence through the streets of Rome starts out in a perfunctory fashion, then continues to escalate until it reaches a level of absurdity that is pretty admirable.

It should all be great fun (and the Rome car chase, as well as parts of ""Fallout,"" this film's 2018 predecessor, are exhilarating), but my overriding gripe with the way McQuarrie approaches the material remains the same: he takes it way too seriously. His technical dexterity is undeniable, but the showmanship, sadly, comes in low doses.
Hayley Atwell as Grace and Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt in a scene from
It's a shame, because a new addition to the cast, a high-stakes thief called Grace, played with verve by Hayley Atwell, could have given the franchise the shot in the arm it needed. Alas, Atwell is too often reduced to a cog in McQuarrie's machine, showing vulnerability and deceit when the film calls for it and not much else. Also showing considerable squandered potential is the film's chief human baddie, an enigmatic sociopath named Gabriel, well played by Esai Morales. There's a glimmer of a better film whenever this villain exploits Hunt's fears and weak spots.

But McQuarrie, working from a screenplay credited to him and Erik Jendresen, is too busy grinding the film to a halt at various intervals to have the characters explain the plot. You know, because popcorn-munching Joe Moviegoer can't be trusted to figure out the story unless it's being spoonfed. More than anything, the summary powwows only serve to make an already overlong sequel even longer. They also deprive the movie of the element of surprise, something that's pretty important in a spy tale like this one. Everything is overexplained to the extent that we find ourselves one step ahead of these agents.

Moreover, for a film where AI is the threat, it kind of defeats the purpose to have the bulk of the narrative revolve around a fancy key that, like this story, is made up of two halves. It undermines the intangible menace when you have the characters chasing a thingamajig with blinking lights.
Esai Morales as Gabriel and Pom Klementieff as Paris in a scene from

""Dead Reckoning Part One"" plays like a heavily annotated variation on Alfred Hitchcock's ""Saboteur,"" with shades of Michael Mann. If ""Rogue Nation"" and ""Fallout"" felt more like work than escapism, ""Reckoning 1,"" feels like taking a class. You stop wondering about what new obstacle Hunt will have to face and start asking yourself whether that last bit of information will be on the test. It dots every ""i"" and crosses every ""t"" with such fastidiousness that it almost doesn't come across as one half of a two-part story,

At the center is an aging A-lister with off-screen baggage who's become more of a brand than a screen presence. Cruise used to take chances. He tended to throw a couple of smaller films in between the action tentpoles to mix it up and get his creative juices flowing. Where did that versatile actor go? (Back in 2004, he even played a bad guy in Mann's ""Collateral."") The Oscar nominee, who turned 61 on Monday, is finally showing his age on screen. That's good. He's also stiffer than he's ever been. That's bad. He's locked in a cycle of codependency with his current director, delivering a film that feels meticulously planned and mapped out. What's missing is the thrill of the unknown.
Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones in a scene from

""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"": The archaeologist with a fedora and a propensity for getting into tight spots didn't become a household name just because of his good looks and his ability to crack a whip. There was a secret sauce behind the implausible escapes, grotesque imagery, ancient puzzle-solving and good old-fashioned Nazi bashing. The melding of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas' sensibilities yielded a winning trio of 1930s adventures (""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" its prequel, ""Temple of Doom,"" and ""The Last Crusade""), as well as a jovial misfire set in the '50s (2008's ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull""), propelled as they were by a juvenile spirit rooted in the matinee serials that inspired them.

But fast forward to this fifth, supposedly final entry, and it's difficult to muster up any enthusiasm. The return of Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) — older, grumpier, more cynical — for one last adventure ought to have been a slam dunk, but ""Dial of Destiny"" is a summer bummer: sluggish, poorly paced and, worst of all, ugly to look at. It's a bloated eyesore that siphons off whatever goodwill we have toward its titular academic/unlikely action hero.
Mads Mikkelsen as Dr. Voller in a scene from

An extended prologue set in 1944, when the tide was beginning to turn against Germany in World War II, threatens to derail the movie before it even gets going. Jones and fellow archaeologist Basil Shaw (Toby Jones) are after a priceless artifact, which they believe to be in the Nazis' possession. The duo unwittingly stumble into the titular relic, an invention of Greek mathematician Archimedes that wasn't the treasure were looking for, sought by Nazi scientist Jürgen Voller (Mads Mikkelsen). All three men and a train filled with Nazis will converge aboard a train filled with priceless items taken during the invasion of European cities.

It should be a blast, but the sequence is a bust. The biggest culprit here is Ford's de-aging. Rather than turning him into a younger, wax figure version of his younger self, much like Robert De Niro in ""The Irishman"" or Robert Downey Jr. in ""Captain America: Civil War,"" it makes Ford look like one of the characters Tom Hanks voiced in ""The Polar Express."" Uncanny valley Indy is a distracting miscalculation in a sequence that, in retrospect, feels like dead weight in a movie that could have used more than a little trimming.

""Dial of Destiny"" then jumps forward to the summer of 1969, 12 years after the events in ""Crystal Skull."" Jones is teaching at Hunter College in New York City, a grizzled shell of his former self. Also, conspicuously alone. He's approached by a face from the past, Basil's daughter Helena (""Fleabag's"" Phoebe Waller-Bridge), who bombards him with questions about Archimedes' dial. Unbeknownst to them, Voller is tracking Helena, and all of a sudden, the game is afoot once more. Dangerous goons, exotic locales, the whole nine yards.

But I sat in an IMAX auditorium, staring at the oversized IMAX screen, as ""Indy 5"" lurched from one setpiece to another, bored. Where is the spark, that glint in its eye that separated the Indiana Jones movies, even ""Crystal Skull,"" from other period adventure films? It's locked away in a box at an undisclosed government storage facility. Ford does what he can, and there are a few moments when he comments on his character's aging body that are pretty touching, but he's fighting a losing battle here.

You could fault the new cast members, an insufferable Waller-Bridge in particular. But no. The bulk of the blame falls squarely on James Mangold, the filmmaker who was brave, or foolhardy, enough to take the reins from Spielberg. The ""Walk the Line"" and ""Ford v Ferrari"" director has an uneven body of work, but at least on paper, he made sense as a viable contender for the hot seat. But while his affection for Dr. Jones is palpable, he doesn't have the chops to bring those hairy pursuits to life the way Uncle Steven did. He lacks the clarity and spatial logic Spielberg brought to the table. In its place is a green screen-driven muddle, a morass of medium shots that, instead of placing viewers in the middle of the peril, turns them into casual observers.
Phoebe Waller-Bridge as Helena and Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones in a scene from

""Dial of Destiny"" is somewhat intriguing on the edges, with its late-'60s period and the transitional cultural moment the U.S. was going through, but the screenplay, credited to five writers, finds little inspiration beyond the obvious signposts. After what feels like an eternity, it seems like the film is going to deliver on its promise of what Archimedes' invention is capable of, but the payoff is astonishingly muted. It's too little, too late, bringing this overproduced stumble with too many cooks in the kitchen to a disappointing conclusion, and reducing what could have been a fulfilling swan song to a feeble victory lap. What a letdown.",no
20,"Cruise doesn't direct, yet he's still the ""author"" on films he produces, famously and consistently calling the shots in the action-flick category. The broad success of Top Gun: Maverick demands that Cruise's choices be taken seriously, even though the latest, Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One, cannot be taken seriously.

That three-clause title puts Dead Reckoning in the realm of excess. We're already familiar with its caper-teamwork premise (originally derived from the 1960s TV show), and the elaborate, large-scale action stunts have reached such surfeit that, in addition to becoming the selling point, they are the raison d'être of the series.

That the regime media dutifully celebrate Cruise's auteur calculations should be cause for concern. Thrills were an overture to the heroic, death-defying humor of the James Bond films, but something is wrong when a 27-year-old franchise grinds out familiar routines in the same blatant, humorless manner. Admittedly, Cruise's house director Christopher McQuarrie has gotten better at being a circus ringmaster, but he has mastered a worthless craft. In Dead Reckoning, McQuarrie's emphasis on in-your-face spectacle calls upon the most primitive kinetic responses to fast motor vehicles, dizzying heights, and point-blank physical and mechanical violence. It garners rote reviewer response: ""This is why we go to the movies,"" one shill gushed. I hadn't read that cliché since it was used for Peter Jackson's now forgotten King Kong remake.

Reducing cinema to gimmicky sensationalism is regressive, especially when McQuarrie's repetition is this witlessly conventional. In visual terms, McQuarrie and Cruise outclass the tiresome Fast and Furious franchise, but these careening chases and top-of-the-world vistas are more like theme-park rides. As super spy Ethan Hunt, Cruise's running atop a speeding train is a too-literal stunt. It doesn't make him Buster Keaton — McQuarrie lacks the visual rhythm that Chad Stahelski displays in the dazzling John Wick movies. Without that essential cinematic wit, the M:I films seem devoted to anesthetizing our senses. Overplaying depth and height dimensions gets old. The instant the stunts are over, there's nothing to think about. ""Wow!"" is an empty expression.

The best of the M:I series was 2011's Ghost Protocol directed by cartoonist Brad Bird, who understood spatial humor. (Plus, back then, Ethan's teammates were still characters, spying and fighting with credible competitive emotion.) Ghost Protocol's hands-on, close-up stunts were fascinating illustrations of something at stake. Ethan/Cruise's mature face adds character — a failed idea in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny. Yet Dead Reckoning keeps reshuffling interchangeable uninteresting females (Rebecca Ferguson, Vanessa Kirby, Hayley Atwell), and the pretend political risks (this time involving AI — talk about ghost protocol!) are no more substantial than the geopolitics of Top Gun: Maverick.

The personal — auteurist — elements of the ever accumulating, nonstop action stunts reveal Cruise's yahoo taste: Born in 1962, having grown up on both James Bond and Bruce Lee exploits, he entered Hollywood during the Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford), Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger phase, when movie stars seemed detached from their craven blockbusters. As Cruise vacillated between high-concept deals and art projects — Days of Thunder, The Firm, Born on the Fourth of July, Far and Away, Magnolia, Eyes Wide Shut, The Last Samurai — his sincere play-acting still didn't seem personal, as Andrew Sarris theorized auteur films must.

Cruise's collaborations with Spielberg on Minority Report and War of the Worlds were career peaks for both, convincing me that Cruise was a superb actor. He was tragicomic perfection in Lions for Lambs and Tropic Thunder, capable of conveying spiritual and political meaning. Like a lot of people, I expected the same in the facile Top Gun: Maverick. Now we know how impersonal that film really was, so are the M:I movies, despite the star-auteur's professional dedication to them.

Welles, Olivier, and Cassavetes were intellectuals, yet Cruise possesses the popular knack they lacked (maybe he learned it from actor-auteur Paul Newman, his co-star in The Color of Money). But this shrewdness prevents us from respecting Dead Reckoning Part One. The return of Henry Czerny as Kittredge, the villain from Brian De Palma's first M:I installment, raises a topical issue. He warns Ethan: ""This is our chance to control the truth, the concepts of right and wrong for everyone for centuries to come."" This world-conquering threat relates to everything audiences deal with outside, and then trashes that concern. The auteur of Top Gun: Maverick missed the opportunity to give this weightless movie gravitas.",no
21,"As the title suggests, the ending is really the beginning in Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One, the latest over-the-top installment in the venerable espionage franchise.

Once again emphasizing spectacle over substance, this convoluted sequel — the seventh entry since 1996 — is another showcase for some dazzling set pieces, which has become the series' calling card.

However, this elaborate adventure struggles to raise the sociopolitical stakes as intended while blending Cold War intrigue with a high-tech cautionary tale, falling short on genuine suspense.

After a tense opening sequence set aboard a doomed Russian submarine, the globetrotting story finds top-secret government operative Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) accepting an assignment to locate a two-piece brass key that might stop a rogue A.I. ""entity"" with the power to manipulate and eventually destroy humankind. But nobody knows for sure.

Ethan teams up with loyal sidekicks Benji (Simon Pegg) and Luther (Ving Rhames), who sums up the task nicely: ""The fate of the world depends on finding whatever it unlocks.""

The first step is tracking down and forming an alliance with a petty thief (Hayley Atwell) who's believed to possess at least one half of the key. But others have the same intel, most notably a terrorist (Esai Morales) and an enigmatic arms dealer (Vanessa Kirby) who are hot on their heels.

Uncertain who he can trust, Ethan must navigate a maze of shifting loyalties and cloudy motives, alluring women and suspicious bureaucrats. Plus, he becomes morally conflicted while forced to confront his past.

As debonair as ever, Cruise generates sympathy and emotional depth with his usual magnetic charisma. The vague nature of the mission is both compelling and frustrating as the traditional line between heroes and villains is blurred and the endgame for all parties is uncertain. It's boils down to a battle of wits and resilience for power and control.

Meanwhile, returning director Christopher McQuarrie employs sweeping camera movements, daredevil stunt work, exotic backdrops, and effects-driven flourishes to provide plenty of thrills for those willing to set their brains to autopilot.

Highlights include an extended car chase through the crowded streets of Rome and a breathtaking climactic white-knuckle showdown aboard a train.

Still, there's not much beneath the slick surface of a screenplay that doesn't withstand logical scrutiny. With every harrowing twist, Ethan's invincibility is never in doubt, and neither is that of a franchise that pauses on a cop-out cliffhanger.",no
22,"Is it really possible that we're only one final death-defying stunt away from the end of the Mission: Impossible series? If you believe Tom Cruise, then you might want to savor the stunt that's at the heart of the terribly-titled Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, which is what happens when you blow your punctuation load within the first 20 characters and still have to deal with that this film will have a direct sequel. It's on the poster and trailer, and everybody knows it's coming. And yet. When the film stops for Cruise's death-defying motorcycle-assisted BASE jump off of the side of a cliff – it quite literally grinds things to a full halt, interrupting the pacing of the entire sequence of which it is only a facet and cutting the sound out so that we may witness it with appropriate reverence – it is breathtaking. If one were to lop off the final hour of Dead Reckoning and present it as a standalone feature, there's a real argument to be made that those baffling critics who claimed that the last film in the franchise, Fallout, was heir apparent to Fury Road might have been on to something.

Christopher McQuarrie, who is becoming the only consistent director that the franchise has ever had – by the time it ends, he'll have directed as many installments as had existed when he came on in 2015 – weaves together a thrilling and suspenseful conclusion (something the films have lacked since the days of De Palma and Woo), while also eliding the assumed cliffhanger that a subtitle like Part One might suggest. It's just a bummer that the two hours that exist before it – that's right, this movie is about as long as your average baseball game now – are underwhelming in the same way that every one of his installments since Rogue Nation (a feat never equaled in terms of style and pace) have been.

After his two-hundredth disavowal, pursuit by governments around the world, and ultimate victory against the forces of darkness and the people whom he said he couldn't make the impossible mission possible to complete, Ethan Hunt (Cruise) is tasked with another mission: track down his old colleague Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), and recover one half of the ""cruciform"" key, which when joined together, unlocks a mystery at the heart of a sunken Russian submarine under the Antarctic Ice. This time, however, our overlord villain is a digital one: An AI that, to the astonishment of the NSA director (Cary Elwes), has managed to infiltrate all government services without breaking a virtual sweat. Control of this AI is a top priority for the CIA's Kittridge (Henry Czerny, reprising his role from years ago), who also happens to run the Impossible Mission Force (I guess. I'm really not sure, given how intentionally convoluted these films are), who believes that it being in US hands will preserve them as the world's sole superpower for the foreseeable future.  Naturally, Hunt comes to disagree, especially when a familiar face from his pre-IMF past pops up: Gabriel (Esai Morales, who rocks this part like a Quiet Storm track), the man whose murderous deeds put Hunt on the path to superspydom, who is now working for the AI to ensure global anarchy. To stop him, Hunt will need all of his friends – Faust, Luther (Ving Rhames), and Benji (Simon Pegg) – on his side and the help of an international thief named Grace (Hayley Atwell), who may be a friend or foe in the making.

There's something to be said for consistency, but when paralleled with its most high-profile competitor, the M:I movies often come up lacking in most departments, aside from the stunt work. It's easy to forget that the first Mission: Impossible wouldn't have existed without the precarity that the Bond franchise found itself in after the collapse of the Soviet Union, arriving a scant six months after Goldeneye hit theaters. One bad choice, and the M:I movies might have overtaken their overseas rival, but Martin Campbell's film managed to bring Bond into a new era and establish an essential modernity to the Bond series – this is partially why he was a natural choice to come back for Daniel Craig's first installment, Casino Royale, after all. M:! is, strangely enough, limited in its ability to do the same kind of jukes when faced down by the defensive line of obsolescence: It is a rebootquel, lest ye forget, one of the first to successfully bring a TV franchise to the screen while retaining its quality, and is as such burdened by continuity in a way that Bond isn't. But aside from its action bona fides, it has grown steadily more stylistically inert as the years have passed. The musical chairs nature of the Bond franchise brought innovations to build upon, but once McQuarrie became the series' overseer – placed there by its owner, Tom Cruise – the films' style and look notably declined from installment to installment. The M:I movies never quite recovered from JJ Abrams' attempt to make a maximalist episode of Alias out of III, and compared to the imagery that Roger Deakins, Hoyte van Hoytama, and Linus Sandgren brought to Bond in the interim, the M:I movies look rough.

The central problem with the McQuarrie-era Mission: Impossible films is Cruise himself, as the status quo established by Ghost Protocol doesn't suit Hunt's character or his talents as much as one might think for a franchise that quite literally owes its perpetuation to his involvement as producer. Hunt is, to put it mildly, a fucking bummer: For all of his outrageous stunts and actions, he's a masochist with a messiah complex whose few meager pleasures in life come from his assertions that he's saving lives and they'll never know it, like a skyscraper-scaling De Bergerac, and his friendships, which ultimately resemble the relationship an office manager has with their employees, operating on the same sliding scale of jocularity.

He is absurdly, painfully bland as written, and the few times that Cruise betrays something more than angst, anger, or simmering anxiety (barring the occasionally winsome reaction to a Pegg or Rhames joke) is when the final emotion crosses the fourth wall at the onset of one of his stunts. He sounds genuinely terrified to hop off that mountain – who on Earth would blame him for that? It's the closest I've related to Ethan Hunt since at least 2005. But, perhaps, this stoicism is by design: Bond has slowly morphed away from a fantasy of Fleming's, distilling aspects of his wartime compatriots (which he himself did not possess) into an archetypical hero, an avatar of the audience's desire – a man of action who savors the good things in life but who, also, retains that sensitive element that On Her Majesty's Secret Service gave the character — while Hunt is Cruise's dream version of himself.

Cruise's intensity is often cited as the key to his appeal – he's perpetually focused on whatever task is at hand, be it learning pool or bringing a proper end to the Vietnam War – but intensity only goes so far. His best characters share a rakish element to their personalities that Hunt painfully lacks. If you want to know why Top Gun: Maverick succeeded on an emotional level, it's that Cruise was able to tap into that vein at its full wattage – it's hard to imagine Hunt gleefully messing with his superiors or leaping out of a date's second-story window to avoid her daughter in the kitchen – and there is genuine poetry in watching that character mature while retaining that core irascibility. This has been a defining feature of his work for decades, only for it to be totally stripped out of the M:I franchise in recent years, regardless of how many accolades he received for Edge of Tomorrow (in which he dipped fully into scumbag protagonist territory) or how much money the Jack Reacher movies made (his hyper-competence and quirks are played for true laughs, but are also characteristics that are sorely missed in Hunt, no matter one's opinions of the franchise's overall quality). Bird recognized this, and so did McQuarrie, to an extent: it's the reason Jeremy Renner took on some of those duties once it was decided that Hunt needed a film or two to brood over something.

McQuarrie also tries to solve this problem by bringing in Atwell, but her pluck isn't enough to fill the gaping maw left by Cruise's lack of charisma. Their scenes together are decently amusing – a chase that sees them speeding through the streets of Rome in a sporty secret-agent Fiat 500 while handcuffed to one another feels taken from a Roger Moore Bond, slide-whistles absent – but her slotted status as proto-recruit prevents any sort of flame from forming between the two of them, especially since Hunt is still pining after his SAS colleague and has a stack of decades in between their respective ages. Rhames (whose appearances in these movies are delights) and Pegg are usually limited to earpiece banter, given that they're tech nerds on laptop duty with the maps and security cameras and such needing minding, and Ferguson is essentially a mirror of Hunt in competence and attitude.

In short, there's a charismatic hole at the heart of Dead Reckoning's core ensemble that only gets greater when McQuarrie attempts some level of revisionism: our villain spotlights Hunt's failures in a classic fashion – sure, you've saved the world a hundred times, but you can't protect the people that you love – that feels lacking when you hold It up to the romantic angst of Craig's Bond, where the whole ""tortured soul"" deal is part of what makes him so goddamn hot. Dead Reckoning, ultimately,is closer to the perspective that the sportswriter (reductive, I know) Jon Bois took when trying to craft a body count for 24's Jack Bauer, albeit in a milder and more amiable fashion than Bauer's own ""death curse:"" You must keep doing the stunts. I can't keep doing the stunts. I'll do the stunts.  ",no
23,"Remember when Mission: Impossible movies were fun and not just hours and hours of tedious mayhem?

Even since chief Tom Cruise enabler Christopher McQuarrie took over the series and gave into his star's extreme stunt whims, the adventures of Ethan Hunt and the Impossible Mission Force have lost their initial spark, replaced by something far more hard-nosed and weighty, even as the number of often thrilling action set pieces have remained high.

This ill-fitting tone has never been as pronounced as it is in Dead Reckoning Part One, which finds Hunt (Cruise), Luther (Ving Rhames), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Ilsa (Rebecca Ferguson) in pursuit of a two-piece key whose possessor can control a highly advanced AI dubbed ""The Entity"" — a word uttered so many times over the course of nearly three bloated hours that it's a shock something else was chosen as the film's subtitle.

And man, do these characters love to talk. McQuarrie built a reputation on his excellent, verbose Oscar-winning The Usual Suspects script, but rarely has his writing featured such incessant jabbering. A mind-numbing amount of telling instead of showing is on display here as people clumsily attempt to explain ""The Entity,"" peaking early with a ludicrous ""conversation"" at National Intelligence Headquarters where a roomful of high-ranking officials catch Director Denlinger (Cary Elwes) up to speed via what feels like a robotic game of Telephone.

This heavy-handedness gradually renders the entertaining Dead Reckoning Part One unenjoyable, despite multiple impressive high-octane sequences that do what they can to counteract the narrative buzzkills. 

A cat-and-mouse stretch in the Abu Dhabi airport that introduces the team to master thief Grace (Hayley Atwell) and the ever-pursuant team of CIA agents Briggs (Shea Whigham) and Degas (Greg Tarzan Davis) is particularly intriguing. And while the subsequent car chase through Rome feels overly familiar, it's nicely spiced up by the psychotic Paris (Pom Klementieff, Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol. 3) barreling through the city in her armored Hummer, a la Vincent Cassel's villain at the Las Vegas apex of Jason Bourne.

But while a weapon as powerful as ""The Entity"" would naturally attract numerous interested parties, McQuarrie and co-writer Erik Jendresen (Killing Lincoln) struggle to balance the various individuals drawn to it, including returning baddie The White Widow (Vanessa Kirby) and Gabriel (Esai Morales, Ozark), a shadowy figure from Ethan's past.

In true Agatha Christie fashion, these and other key players all converge on — what else? — The Orient Express in an overlong climactic sequence peppered with laughable good luck and hampered by McQuarrie's inability to leave well enough alone, nearly to the extent of his interminable helicopter chase scene at the end of the series' previous installment, Fallout.

To its credit, Dead Reckoning is up front about it being one half of a movie — unlike several other summer 2023 blockbusters — but with Part Two on the way next year, it's difficult to imagine anything but more of the same. That's great news for viewers who appreciate the dumbed-down, charisma-free direction McQuarrie and Cruise have taken this series. But for the rest of us, it's likely going to be yet another long, unpleasant sit.",no
24,"Beating Barbie or Oppenheimer at this summer's box office might seem like an impossible mission, but the 61-year-old actor has history with those. Dead Reckoning Part One, the seventh film in his Bond-esque spy series, arrives just days ahead of its buzzier rivals – and to considerably less fanfare. Can rogue agent Ethan Hunt overturn the odds once more and serve up a blockbuster-sized surprise?

If he does, it won't be thanks to a total reinvention. Dead Reckoning kicks off in much the same way as its predecessors: there's a new world-ending weapon on the scene, a dastardly villain wants to steal it, and Hunt is the only one with wits enough to stop them. Joined by all of his best pals – hacker whizz Luther (Ving Rhames), geeky sidekick Benji (Simon Pegg), blink-and-you'll-miss-her hitwoman Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) – plus a new partner in Hayley Atwell's slippery cat burglar Grace, the Forrest Gump of intelligence operatives runs madly around Abu Dhabi airport, Rome and finally the Orient Express while attempting to track down the key to a super-powered artificial intelligence dubbed The Entity. Fail and the futuristic tech may fall into the wrong hands – creating an omniscient digital overlord that puts humanity's very existence at risk.

As usual, there's an array of mind-boggling set pieces that defy belief. Cruise is thrown into or out of every type of moving vehicle you can imagine – and the much-trailed motorbike cliff-jump doesn't disappoint either. Then there's the extended hand-to-hand combat sequences, which include a meticulously choreographed alleyway brawl and a climactic knife fight atop a moving train. Also worthy of mention is the opening desert sandstorm shootout which boasts a hair-raising sound mix that will have you ducking for cover in the cinema, convinced you're dodging bullets shot through a Sahara gale. It all serves to prove that Mission: Impossible works best when it is being as loud and loopy as possible, pairing eye-popping practical effects with its bombastic score (this time reinvented to thrilling effect by film composer of the moment Lorne Balfe).

The problems come when Dead Reckoning tries to be too clever. Production on the film wrapped in 2021, so Cruise and director Christopher McQuarrie couldn't have known how prescient the AI themes would prove to be. Now, as ChatGPT dominates the internet and we all wait anxiously for robots to make us redundant, the film's setup seems like a masterstroke. But it's sadly also its downfall. After an exciting first third, we drift into a series of bloated exposition sessions where thinly drawn side-characters spend far too long talking up the apocalyptic (but actually quite vague) threat of AI. Even the main baddie, Esai Morales' mononymous creep Gabriel, doesn't really understand what's going on. He seems to believe his fast-evolving gadget can actually predict the future, making bold predictions that turn out true for no reason other than he's said them. The plot borrows from Westworld and aims for cerebral but ends up coming out like a half-baked Christopher Nolan brain fart.

Dead Reckoning's spectacular finale does well to bring things back on brand – seriously, the closing action tableau is as impressive as any you'll see – but by then most will have stopped caring because their heads hurt. When's Barbie out again?",no
25,"The Summer of Echoes continues in surprising fashion: who woulda thunk that the much-lauded Mission: Impossible series would trot out so many of the same elements as the rather less-lauded Fast & Furious franchise — specifically, Fast X? Where to start, besides a lengthy runtime and a half-finished story? How about the return of a villain from our hero's past, a villain who delights in causing suffering even more than he delights in killing? And in both cases, he's portentously presented as the satanic opposite to our sainted hero — Fast X's baddie gets called ""the Devil"" and taunts his opposite, ""Saint Dominic,"" while MI:DR:P1 gives us a ""Dark Messiah"" going up against Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt, who must not only save the world, but must do while ""bearing his particular cross."" Then there's the extended car chase through Rome — but perhaps that's just de rigueur at this point. And the climactic explosion isn't quite the same; just similar. What's perhaps most troublesome is the dramatic fatigue indicated by going meta: Fast X acknowledged the series' cheerful rejection of the laws of physics, while here, we get an extended exchange on the absurdity of a rogue super-agent who is offered missions that he may or may not choose to accept. (All because he was once a bad boy who was offered ""a choice"" — make sure you pronounce it with sufficient gravitas and grandeur!) Cruise the stuntman is reliably spectacular here, but Cruise the actor seems a bit scattered, perhaps because he has two women to care about this time 'round, and an enemy who is more machine than man. And Hunt the character? He fails personally when it counts, but suffers not a single consequence because of it. Sigh. As for director Christopher McQuarrie, he relies a bit too much on hey presto sleight of hand, and the pleasing jolt of watching marbles in a maze careen off one another in precise fashion to reach the desired end.",no
26,"Perhaps the most unbelievable thing in ""Mission Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One"" isn't the nifty gravity-defying stunts on a train, or the deceitful trickery that unfolds in low-key airport escapade, or the extended car chase through the streets of Italy, but that the opening sequence features a Russian submarine, Seebastopol, sinking in the Bering Sea. It is an unfortunately timed bit of cinema that almost casts a pall over this bloated film. 

Cruise just does not seem to be having fun here, and viewers may share his fatigue.

The Russian submarine is sunk during an underwater skirmish in what might be an imaginary game of ""Battleship."" Torpedoes are launched by both vessels, but suddenly things vanish when they are supposed to make impact. What emerges from this incident is the film's McGuffin, a special key that is comprised of two parts that need to be interlocked to access ""The Entity"" which has the capability to overtake the world intelligence networks and weaponize them. So, obviously, this key should not fall into the wrong person's hands.

Enter Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) of the IMF. (That's ""Impossible Mission Force,"" not ""International Monetary Fund,"" as one character wonders.) Ethan has chosen to accept his mission to recover the two keys. And so begins an overlong game of Three-card Monte, as the keys are snatched up and pocketed and stolen (step and repeat and repeat) by various players from familiar faces including Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) and The White Widow (Vanessa Kirby), to series newcomers Gabriel (Esai Morales) and Grace (Hayley Atwell). Actually, Gabriel is not new to Ethan; they have a past that is shown briefly in flashbacks that provides a little context. 

Gabriel is actually the best thing in ""Mission Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One."" The suave Morales slinks through the film making his unflappable villain alluring. He can disappear as in the aforementioned airport episode, and he is also all-knowing, informing one character that they will betray him — and why — before it happens. Morales is such a smooth operator one might wish he played Ethan Hunt because Tom Cruise looks weary in the role.

Cruise just does not seem to be having fun here, and viewers may share his fatigue. His initial meeting with Grace, a pickpocket he picks up because she may hold a key to the keys, is flat, rather than charming. Cruise's megawatt smile seems dimmed. A subsequent comic action sequence has the pair handcuffed together trying to drive a tiny yellow Fiat through the streets of Italy and encountering a series of obstacles, but it is neither amusing nor exciting. Moreover, there is no chemistry between these attractive leads. At least Hayley Atwell tries to imbue Grace with an air of mystery that prompts viewers to question if she is trustworthy, but that's pretty much all Atwell gets to do. She is a welcome addition but mostly wasted. 

Director Christopher McQuarrie mostly puts his cast through the motions without creating any emotion. ""Mission Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One"" is almost devoid of thrills. A criminally boring sequence involves Ethan's colleague Benji (Simon Pegg) having to defuse a bomb by answering a series of riddles. When ""The Entity,"" hacks into Luther's (Ving Rhames) tech and gives Ethan wrong directions during a foot chase through Venice, making the hero too late, what transpires lacks the desired impact. McQuarrie overplays the scene here reaching operatic heights he should save for the daredevilling.

The entire film feels jury-rigged as if every action sequence — and there are too few of them — is designed by an algorithm rather than a human. Perhaps the nefarious Entity wrote the lame screenplay? The script, which feels wholly artificial, was actually penned by McQuarrie, Bruce Geller and Erik Jendresen. But it does seem odd that Denlinger (Cary Elwes), the Director of National Intelligence, asks to define the meaning of the word ""sentient"" when he is told The Entity has become sentient. ""Are you telling me, it has a mind of its own?"" he asks, incredulous. Yes, Delinger, that is what ""sentient"" means. And it is no clearer when The Entity is vaguely described as ""a mind-reading, shapeshifting, incarnation of chaos.""",no
27,"Everything about Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One is larger than life. With a thin plot filled out by half-hour chase sequences, the film is 163 minutes long: even at the press screening, people were checking their phones. Mission: Impossible (1996) was 110 minutes long. Mission: Impossible 2: 124 minutes. Mission: Impossible III: 126. Later sequels ran for 133, 131 and 147 minutes respectively; Dead Reckoning Part Two will be released next year. Richard Wagner's 1874 Ring cycle totals about 15 hours of music. If Dead Reckoning Part Two is the same length as Part One, the Mission: Impossible franchise will soon exceed the Romantic masterpiece in length. And Tom Cruise has assured us Ethan Hunt is not finished yet.

The first film was made by Brian De Palma, the art-house director of Carrie, Scarface and Dressed to Kill (notorious for its depiction of transsexuals as dangerous sexual deviants). The budget of Mission: Impossible was $80m. The budget of Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One is $290m, seemingly largely spent on blowing up a bridge. The first film has a 66 per cent approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, which proudly repeats lines such as, ""You can't escape your past,"" sits at 99 per cent. Eleven of the 20 highest rated movies on the site postdate 2015. In 1996 two of the top ten grossing films starred Tom Cruise, and two were sequels or spin-offs. In 2022 Cruise only starred in one, and they all were sequels or spin-offs.

Much ink has already been spilled praising Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One's representation of women, or criticising its conceit. This seems as absurd to me as a criticising the scripts of PornHub videos.

Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One begins with a Russian submarine mysteriously detecting an aggressor and firing missiles at it, before the aggressor disappears from the radar (""A phantom – a ghost in the machine!"" exclaims the captain). The missiles are redirected towards the Russians' own submarine and explode, the camera zooming in on a cross hanging around the neck of a dead Russian submariner. Then ""the Impossible Mission Force"" instructs agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) to locate a cruciform key (oohhhhh) to unlock the source code of the Entity, an all-powerful enemy that is basically AI gone rogue.

In a shoot-out in the Arabian Desert, Hunt saves sexy MI6 agent Ilsa Foust (Rebecca Sundström); in a sequence in Abu Dhabi airport, he enlists sexy double-crossing thief Grace (Hayley Atwell). Hunt goes on a car chase through Rome, attends a ball in Venice and executes a dazzling motorcycle-parachute leap on to a runaway train in the Austrian Alps. There is some discussion of AI, which seems really scary.

A sentient nuclear bomb (AI?) asks Hunt's sidekick Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) questions such as, ""What is always approaching but never arrives?"" and, ""Are you afraid of death?"" The AI takes human form as a middle-aged Hispanic man (Esai Morales). Of course, Hunt finds the key – but as this is just part one, we don't know what the key unlocks. The acting, script and Christopher McQuarrie's direction are all adequate.

For some reason the press release for the filmis 65 pages long. It includes sections titled ""THE DREAM TEAM"" and ""GIANT LEAPS."" It begins: ""On 6 September 2020, the first day of principal photography on Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, Tom Cruise drove a motorbike off a mountain. Specifically, he drove a custom-made Honda CRF 250 off a purpose-built ramp on the side of Norway's Helsetkopen mountain."" In the moments before, Hunt helpfully explains the details of this stunt to Dunn: ""How can I possibly…"" We are alerted to the self-driving capability of Dunn's BMW crossover, perched on the same glorious mountain top.

But the stunts are real. When I complained to men at a party that I couldn't go to the beach because I had to see the new Mission: Impossible, they all said: ""Why are you complaining? Tom Cruise does all his own stunts.""

Tom Cruise is 61 years old, a Scientologist and one of the most interesting men in the world. As I wrote this review, a friend texted me: ""Is Tom Cruise the last eunuch?"" In Dead Reckoning Part One, Cruise is frequently on top of Atwell, but never has sex with her. When he speaks to her, he is often sitting on a table. When he speaks to men, they are often on the floor. He never appears to be 5ft 7in and, perhaps, the reason that more than a billion dollars has been spent on Mission: Impossible movies is for Tom Cruise to appear tall. ",no
28,"27 years ago, Ethan Hunt accepted a dangerous mission, one that would take him all over the world. A battle that saw him be turned against his longtime mentor, played by Jon Voight. Remember how fresh Brian De Palma's smashing 1996 thriller was? Six films later, and the Tom Cruise-driven adventure series won't stop, can't stop with the death-defying stunts and intelligent storylines.

But everyone hits a twig barely sticking up out of the snow from time to time, and while the Mission: Impossible series is seemingly unstoppable and highly successful, it's bound to happen. Upon leaving the screening of Dead Reckoning Part one, the seventh edition and the weightiest at 163 minutes, I felt something I hadn't felt in a long time with these movies: let down.

Yes, I enjoyed John Woo's flawed yet rollicking original sequel, which is the most hated next to the hybrid-produced M:I 3. Following Brad Bird's entertaining uneven Ghost Protocol, Christopher McQuarrie joined the Cruise train and formed a cinematic bond with the movie superstar.

2015's Rogue Nation and 2018's Fallout were step-ups for an already electrifying series of movies that combined action, thrills, and depth. However, an exhausting Part One, with an eighth already being filmed, had me feeling less than thrilled to revisit this one. If there's one thing about the Mission: Impossible series, it's that avoiding a rewatch, especially with the last two, is nearly impossible.

In order to fully release my take, which has been marinating for two weeks, let's break it down to five things for you to know. I like that method, and it's catnip for writers. Let's get into it.

If there's one reason to buy a ticket, something that's currently clogging up my Rotten Tomatoes rating, it's the relentless action scenes. The much-talked about motorcycle jump in Norway delivers, but an extended train sequence-which does result in a monstrous crash-takes the cake. The hand-to-hand combat work took a step down. How many damn fights can these characters get into before redundancy settles in?

Overall, still pretty good but starting to look a little winded. The extended multi-car chase is just okay, even if it's done practically. I felt worn out most of the time, that is when I wasn't wondering why no one punches down at Cruise.

I love the guy and think of him as one of our last genuine movie stars, but he's painted across this entire movie. I literally wondered when he showered, slept, and ate. It helps to see these people cram down a burrito like Ryan Gosling did in the underrated Russo Brothers flick, The Gray Man. Here, Cruise just keeps kicking, punching, brooding, running, and kicking until his face loosens from a prolonged stoic stammer.

He's still dialed in as Hunt, but maybe running out of ideas when it comes to reactions and dialogue reads? The dialogue runs a little hot on overwrought threats, and Cruise can only stare through Esai Morales's head so many times. Speaking of which…

I didn't like Morales's Gabriel. He's a fine actor, but this take was better in Netflix's Ozark--that is before his character caught a face full of lead. Here, he's witty and cunning with some athletics thrown in for good measure. The problem is most of his dialogue and story are dull and ripe with retreaded tire marks.

How many bad guys want to stare into Hunt's past? Will M:I 10 feature 30-35 minutes of de-aged Cruise like Indy 5 did with Harrison Ford just so he can fight another asshole? I sure hope not. Like Mads Mikkelsen in that film, Morales is let down by a less-than-potent screenplay.

The biggest issue is that Morales has to follow Superman in the antagonist department. That's just unfortunate. Cavill made for an excellent heel to Hunt in Fallout, and a good bad guy can always help a movie climb over a writing wall.

The confidence and precision in Cavill's work is missing in Morales, who gets a few nice ""I'm so ahead of you, Hunt"" smirks and a couple knife fights to build a character out. He seems like more of a roadblock than a true adversary--something that Philip Seymour Hoffman, Sean Harris, and Cavill captured in spades.

Maybe Part Two fleshes him out a little. For now, it's a letdown.
Pom, Pom Power

She may have been a sweet, mind-controlling Guardian of the Galaxy a couple of months ago, but Pom Klementieff turned heel just like Sup did for this Mission. She's the main henchwoman for Morales's evil Gabriel, taking on Cruise in a tight alley and bashing his smaller cars all over Rome.

Paris, Klementieff's aptly named character, steals the show here. I wanted more time with her than anyone else on screen. Sporting an arsenal of weaponry and skills and looking like Versace's ninja, she swings down like a punk rock star who stepped out of a painting at a museum in France to take on the good guys and gals, including an underused Hayley Atwell and smaller-portioned Rebecca Ferguson.
Paramount Pictures

While a third act story decision lessens her bite, I really enjoyed Ms. Klementieff here.
This Mission is Kind of Dull

McQuarrie wrote Rogue Nation and Fallout with Bruce Geller, but his co-writing pal here is Erik Jendersen and their screenplay is the weak link here. The adventure suddenly seems more dull than before, and the action can't make up for the fact that Hunt should be caught or dead by now. James Bond doesn't go through this much shit, and John Wick decided to take a breather after round 4.

Realism is not what I'm after. Trust me. We left that a few movies ago when Cruise held onto a plane while it took off. It's the concepts and how much tread is left on the tires. How many problems and bad guys can this guy go through, even with a heck of a team. Atwell, Ferguson, Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, and the returned Henry Czerny all do fine jobs. It just doesn't amount to the same amount of excitement and theater-leaving feel that previous entries provided.

The Verdict: If you set the bar high, you're bound to smash into it eventually. While Mission: Impossible-Dead Reckoning Part One (gosh, what a mouth full) didn't hit it smack dab in the middle, the precision in this one isn't as sharp as the last two. Tom Cruise may be the energizer bunny of action, but even those batteries eventually die.

Ethan Hunt refuses to, but I hope Dead Reckoning's… reckoning is better. ",yes
29,"At particular moments during Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning, Part One, it's possible to ignore the color and sound and imagine you're watching a clip from one of the masters of silent cinema. Here's Buster Keaton jumping off a train, here's Harold Lloyd flinging himself across an abyss to grab a railing that barely looks like it can hold him. This isn't to say that Tom Cruise's new action movie is lacking in innovation or somehow lesser than those old-fashioned predecessors. Rather, it's a worthy addition to the pantheon of gutsy, visceral cinema where part of the fun is wrangling with the question, ""How did they do that?"" even though you don't really need to know the answer. You just want to see the hero make the jump and keep running.

And run he does. The headlong sprint is one of Cruise's calling cards, and he hasn't aged out of it yet. In one scene in this, the seventh installment in the Mission: Impossible series, his character, Ethan Hunt, escapes from a tight scrape by running full tilt along the roof of an airport, and the moment is as comical as it is thrilling. What is he going to do when he gets to the edge of the roof considering that the bad guys are still everywhere? No matter, it looks cool, and the swooping aerial shot thrills the senses. In fact, the plot hinges on several moments of outlandish coincidence, executed with brash confidence as if Ethan knew precisely what the outcome was going to be. Swift pacing, however, keeps your attention focused on what's coming next rather than dwelling on how unlikely what just happened might be. Whether you find it thrilling or silly, you feel like you're getting your money's worth.

That's the line that this film flirts with crossing, again and again. Directed by Christopher McQuarrie from a script he wrote with Erik Jendresen (and based on the original television series developed by Bruce Geller), the film toggles from maximally absurd to breathtakingly exciting. Both of these dimensions of tone are artfully crafted and executed with top-shelf filmmaking prowess. An early scene features a collection of super-serious government operatives who each intone one line of earth-shattering exposition, like a Greek chorus of doom. The cast seems to be one twitch away from bursting out laughing at the silliness of it all, but they manage to play it straight. An over-explaining scene like this can stop an action movie in its tracks, but McQuarrie frames each talking head at a canted angle in close-up to heighten tension. It's a trick from old Hollywood, and it's expertly deployed, with the added wildcard element of a menacing character lurking out of focus in the background. And is that guy peeling a latex mask from his face to reveal a hidden identity? Of course he is – it's Mission: Impossible, and no trick is left unplayed, no matter how cheesy or improbable.

At this point, Tom Cruise's real-life mission has become the salvation of blockbuster cinema, with last year's spectacular Top Gun: Maverick, and now this globe-spanning extravaganza with one epic set piece after another. Cruise seems to have lost none of his vigor, and he famously executes many of his own most outrageous stunts, including the hair-raising motorcycle cliff jump featured in the film's trailers. The situation that puts him there is entirely preposterous, but it isn't even the most thrilling episode in this adventure which also features a fist fight atop a speeding train, a high-speed car chase through the streets of Rome and a hair-raising train wreck and escape sequence that would have had Buster Keaton calling for a safety harness. Speeding trains and pianos dangling from a fraying rope have been effective tropes for as long as cinema has existed, and still retain the power to make audiences squirm and cheer.

While this film's plot stands mostly alone from previous installments in the franchise, several familiar characters return, including Luther (Ving Rhames), Benji (Simon Pegg), Kittridge (Henry Czerny) and the enigmatic Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), each of whom earns some deepened characterization. A new addition, Grace (Hayley Atwell), generates some plot-driving complications and a romantic dilemma for Ethan which never quite gels; for someone with so much experience outsmarting intelligence services and bad guys all around the globe, Ethan seems inexplicably gullible when it comes to the new girl. Presumably returning in the forthcoming Part Two installment, Grace's character arc may not yet be complete. That's the main issue with Part One, in fact – it all serves as set-up for what comes next. The opening sequence, a nail-biting prologue on a Russian submarine, teases further underwater adventures and an implacable antagonist in an A.I. algorithm known as The Entity. These are storylines that are left incomplete, and so a sense of resolution is forestalled until at least next summer.

Hopefully, Tom Cruise survives the filming. His commitment to derring-do seems to go to greater lengths with each film he makes, and it is a major component in the largely positive critical reception and audience appeal of his productions. In Part One, his face occasionally resembles a loose silicon mask, which in any other movie might be distracting, but in a Mission: Impossible movie it sends up plot hole alerts. (Is he about to pull off his mask and reveal that Ethan Hunt has been someone else all along?) Not to worry, he's just aging. And while Cruise appears to be as vigorous as any actor working in the action genre today, it might be nice to see him settle into some less strenuous roles where he can channel as much intensity into his emotive chops as he puts into jumping out of planes and off of cliffs. And yet, the actor/producer has set up expectations for at least one more mind-blowing escapade. Will he personally pilot a space capsule to crash it into the moon's eyeball? Of course, that sounds ridiculous, but that's exactly what the Mission: Impossible movies do: take absurd stunts from cinema's swashbuckling past and turn it into the most thrilling thing you'll see today. ",yes
30,"The one moment of ""Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One"" where I could not suspend my disbelief was when Tom Cruise had to stop for a minute and psych himself up to ride a motorcycle off a cliff.

Come on! There's nothing Cruise loves more than to jump out of an airplane, fight on top of a moving train, or just run like hell in a ""Mission: Impossible"" movie. That joy in physical filmmaking, of entertainment for entertainment's sake, sets the ""M:I"" movies apart from its sometimes more dour competitors in the action genre.

The first installment of the ""Dead Reckoning"" two-parter is no exception, a deliciously exciting movie packed with amazing stunts, ticking-clock suspense and laugh-out-loud humor — often with all three of those things flowing through the same scene. It opens Wednesday in Madison theaters at Marcus Point, Marcus Palace, AMC Fitchburg and Flix Brewhouse Madison and is a big, loud, fun time at the movies.

""Mission: Impossible"" movies tend to have both a villain and a ""MacGuffin"" — Alfred Hitchcock's term for an object that everybody in the movie wants to get their hands on. In ""Dead Reckoning,"" the villain is not a person but a sophisticated AI creation known as The Entity which has gone rogue and infected all the world's intelligence agencies. Its earthly agent is Gabriel (Esai Morales), a silky-voiced assassin with whom Cruise's Ethan Hunt shares a history.

In classic ""Mission"" fashion, the MacGuffin that can stop this high-tech threat is the lowest-tech thing possible — a metal key, divided into two parts, that can apparently shut it down somehow. As the movie moves from the Bering Sea to Amsterdam to the Arabian Desert to Washington, D.C. (and that's all just before the opening credits start), rival factions are vying to get the key and control the Entity. Hunt and his Impossible Mission Force team are alone in wanting not to control the Entity, but destroy it.

It's really the silliest ""Mission: Impossible"" plot yet, and largely just an excuse for director Christopher McQuarrie to get these characters to chase each other through exotic locations, including a suspenseful cat-and-cat-and-cat-and-mouse chase through an airport in Abu Dhabi, a grim showdown in Venice, and a riotous car chase through Rome, with Hunt driving a canary-yellow Fiat 500 that's not much bigger (or more maneuverable) than a bumper car.

Unlike the brisk five-minute action sequences of a James Bond movie, McQuarrie has space to stretch out these set pieces over 20 minutes or more, building in complexity and excitement. The film's reliance on practical, real-world stunts and effects give the sequences a tactile thrill too often missing from the multiplex these days.

The cast is well-balanced, with series regulars like Hunt's teammates Ilsa (Rebecca Ferguson), Benji (Simon Pegg) and Luther (Ving Rhames) joined by Hayley Atwell, effective as a sly master thief whose pickpocketing skills come in handy. Pom Klementieff radiates such goodness in the ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" movies that it's a treat to see her as a ferocious killer named Paris who clearly loves her day job.

While the fate of the world is at stake (again), there's such a feeling of playfulness to ""Dead Reckoning,"" with its cheeky plot reversals, mask reveals, even some close-up magic. If anything is lacking here, it's that this installment is a little light on the emotional elements that made ""Fallout,"" for me, the best of the series.

But given all the pleasures that ""Dead Reckoning"" has to offer, complaining about that feels like whining that Baskin Robbins only has 31 flavors.",yes
31,"We could add the entire Mission: Impossible franchise to the greatest ""Bruised Arm Movies"" ever list, a cinematic bracket coined by late film critic Roger Ebert to comment on how the thrillingness of a movie will have your date ""grabbing your forearm in a viselike grip."" 

It's true: Tom Cruise can supply the popcorn goods to produce such results, whether he's (quite literally) clinging to the windows of the Burj Khalifa or the side of an airplane as it's taking off or flying a motorcycle off a cliff like he's Evel Knievel. He's not afraid to put the audience front and center of the action without the digital muddiness that often accompanies blockbusters these days.

As exciting as those big stunts are, however, making them function within the narrative takes a whole other skill set. Often, Cruise and his creative partner, filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie (co-writer and director of Mission: Impossible 5-7), can pull it off with great character moments and invite us into the process. (Have you seen Mission: Impossible - Fallout? It's an action movie all-timer.) 

Unfortunately, their latest go, Dead Reckoning Part One, lacks the refreshing energy that makes each entry run at a unique speed. Don't get me wrong: prepare for a handful of extended action sequences worth the price of admission, but also prepare for them to be surrounded by many scenes featuring characters explaining their plans to death. 

The mission? Another world-threatening device is on the brink of being in the wrong hands, and the IMF team (including Cruise, Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames and Rebecca Ferguson) must stop them. Sound familiar? Swap out a few characters to punch up the flavor and insert Cruise doing the wildest things ever on screen. And that's about it. 

An argument could be made that that's all you need with a Mission: Impossible movie, but after seven of them, would it be too much to ask what else the chef has on the menu? Fortunately, there's Hayley Atwell as Grace, a Catwoman-like character who challenges our central field agent/operative in humorous, fun ways. The game of wits between her and Cruise's Ethan Hunt is the highlight of the new film, especially an airport sequence and an incredible car chase complete with handcuffs and big cars smashing into small ones.

Speaking of big cars, one is driven by Guardians of the Galaxy's Pom Klementieff. She portrays a French assassin named Paris, and she has a mysterious and intoxicating vibe. Paris will be sporting a jester look, all while breaking necks and driving a tank of a vehicle through traffic like she's a missile sent to destroy. Through Klementieff's facial expressions and little-talk-more-kicks-to-the-head performance, there's a reason for her madness and a sense of understanding that comes with her chaos.

And it's always a treat to see Ferguson kicking butt. As Ilsa Faust, there's a confidence in her abilities that matches Ethan. Ilsa and Ethan even share a super sweet moment of holding hands while on a boat. You can feel these characters' love and respect for each other, and it's another shining moment.

What isn't so beaming is how the film is shot. The creators do their best to hide the reality that this film was shot during COVID times, but the heavy use of medium shots (that rarely show characters together in the frame) brings down the kineticism. Now imagine these characters constantly rolling through their plans and in a manner that feels copied and pasted from other M:I films. It's so much of the same stuff and that connection and interest to what's happening is slightly lost. Even the movie's opening doesn't kick things off with a light-the-fuse moment. It takes about 30 minutes to really get going.
Cruise is still a king of action, and his hard work in mastering and designing the stunts doesn't go unnoticed. There's a big difference between watching him fight someone on a train compared to a deep-faked Harrison Ford fighting someone on a train in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny. It's the same reason why Top Gun: Maverick's dogfights were as gripping as they were. But the sameness of the franchise is starting to wear down the tread. 

Hopefully, Part Two goes off the rails next year and backs these characters into some truly impossible corners. And more Atwell and camera movement, please!",yes
32,"The seventh instalment in Tom Cruise trying to kill himself on camera the Mission Impossible franchise, the first of two parts, is out now, and it's just as bonkers as you'd expect.

27 years (!) ago, some of you may remember the first MI film, which had at least some focus on espionage, much like the Fast and Furious franchise was once about racing cars. However, the CIA infiltration and the infamous train chase were signs of things to come, and we've since had motorbike duels, helicopter duels, cliffhangers, plane-hangers, and the Burj Khalifa.

Dead Reckoning's predecessor, Fallout, was arguably one of the greatest action movies of all time, so this had big shoes to fill. Unfortunately, the film has veered deep into absurdist territory, with Hunt and sidekicks Luther and Benji (Rhames and Pegg) now facing off against a self-aware, evolving, powerful AI entity we'll call The Thingamajig.

The Thingamajig holds the key to world domination and can only be controlled through a literal key which can access its source code. This has entangled a merry band of rogues trying to find it, including thief Grace (Atwell), MI6 agent Ilsa (Ferguson), black-market arms dealer Alanna (Kirby) and a terrorist from Hunt's past (Morales). All play their parts with great charisma, but the ominous shots of 'the entity' occasionally spoil the fun.

The staples are there – the crew, the masks, the much-talked-about pivotal stunt (riding a motorbike off a mountain), and the beautiful, intelligent women who somehow end up worse than their stupider male counterparts. At times it's like watching a kitsch 1970s Bond movie, and at others, a haunting film noir. The action definitely delivers – be it desert shoot-outs or more train shenanigans – but the plot doesn't make up for it. This won't disappoint hardcore Tom Cruise and action fans, and part two is still to come…",yes
33,"The biggest surprise of Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One is to discover that this series, which began in 1996 and found new life with a focus on action and practical stunts in its fourth installment, still possesses enough ideas to justify its continued existence. In fact, this seventh film ranks among the series' best installments, even though it's more or less recycling/repurposing setpieces we've already seen—either in this franchise or action/spy movies in general—and isn't technically a complete story.

This film's narrative conclusion will come later (about a year from now) in yet another entry. It's difficult to tell whether we should be worried that this one has exasperated whatever steam the series' engine might have left or excitedly anticipate what the filmmakers have left for the tale's finale.

That's to discover another day, though, and in the meantime, co-writer/director Christopher McQuarrie has distilled the best of what this series has had to offer over the decades into a clever and thrilling mix of espionage, action, and character focus, while also bringing a few new conceits into play. It's really quite something to behold and experience, especially when the film is doing what this franchise has come to do better than likely any other movies out there.

The first of the new ideas, introduced in a nifty and mysterious prologue (arguably the most appropriate kind of prologue for a story like this) aboard a top-secret Russian submarine submerged in the Arctic, is this entry's villain. Bypassing the usual archetype of a murderous terrorist/arms dealer/double agent/whoever entirely, the concept of this enemy jumps straight into the biggest promises/threats of the modern day.

It's an artificial intelligence, capable of analyzing every piece of information in the internet-reliant world and making eerily accurate prediction of what any government, organization, or individual will do based on the data it's always collecting. If such a thing sounds silly, that's fine. Surely, all the algorithms tracking our every move online and in the real world will one day appreciate, to the extent that cold coding can, such naïveté.

It's a constant threat, in other words, existing everywhere and nowhere, as Impossible Mission Force agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) learns after sneaking into a clandestine meeting of the heads of every branch of the United States' intelligence apparatus. How he pulls that off, confronts his old foe and current boss Kittridge (Henry Czerny), and manages to escape from such a secure location would seem to be the setup for a fine, sneaky sequence. Here, it's just exposition featuring some craftily constructed surprises, because the filmmakers have so much else in store.

It's tempting to simply list and vaguely describe those other sequences. In fact, it's too tempting.

A lot of this film, co-written by McQuarrie and Erik Jendresen, feels as if it's getting back to the series' roots as a spy thriller, after most of the recent installments gave us some routine plotting to excuse a string of—admittedly exceptional—action scenes. Tellingly, the first big setpiece here isn't about action, basically throwing us into Ethan's attempt to find a key—a literal one—that will unlock the source of the omniscient, omnipotent AI, known as ""the Entity."" While various countries and state players and rogue entities want the Entity for their own ends, Ethan is convinced it needs to be destroyed, lest any one nation, organization, or person hold that much power.

That means he and his team—including Benji (Simon Pegg) and Luther (Ving Rhames)—have to track down the second half of the key (Part of the extended preamble has Ethan obtaining the first half from Rebecca Ferguson's Ilsa). The result is an elaborate cat-and-mouse game in Abu Dhabi International Airport, featuring tactics as newfangled as augmented reality glasses, as well as on-the-fly video editing, and as old-fashioned as sleight-of-hand, as well as foot chases and a race against the ticking clock of a riddle-based bomb. The sequence is orchestrated with inspired, clockwork precision, while also introducing us to a few new characters.

Some are ancillary villains, namely Pom Klementieff's deadly assassin Paris and Esai Morales' enigmatic Gabriel, who has a history with Ethan and is using/being used by the Entity for its uncertain goals. Another is Shea Whigham's Jasper, an IMF agent tasked by Kittridge to find the once-again rogue Ethan, and finally, there's Grace (Hayley Atwell), an expert thief who was hired by an anonymous client to steal the key piece.

She also figures into the film's most giddily executed centerpiece, a car chase through the streets of Rome that comes across as if McQuarrie wants to kill the entire concept of the movie car chase by way of fine-tuning, expanding, and attempting to perfect it. With the sequence's multiple layers and many vehicles and evolving stakes, it's difficult to imagine anyone coming close to matching—let alone topping—the dizzying mix of relative realism (Grace is definitely not prepared to participate in such an endeavor), controlled chaos, and self-aware humor (A comic beat involving a rolling car and its occupants is absurd, hilarious, and changes the dynamic of the chase again) on display here anytime soon.

The rest of the plot, obviously, has Ethan and his team tracking the key's halves to various locations in the hands of assorted players. If it sounds routine, the plotting mostly is, but the continual threat of the Entity and the feeling that our man might have finally met his match elevate it in a sinister and defeated way (Cruise adds a noticeable layer of weariness to the Ethan's determination to save everyone no matter the cost for himself). That atmosphere is palpable during a standoff at a club in Venice that transforms into a chase through the city, with McQuarrie tapping into film noir aesthetics to highlight the desperation.

As if all of this isn't enough, Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One climaxes with yet another phenomenal, layered setpiece. It involves spy games on the Orient Express, a motorcycle chasing a train, a leap of faith that's doubly breathtaking because Cruise makes it obvious that he continues to do his own stunts, a fight atop a speeding train as an homage to the first installment, and a string of cliffhangers that, since one segment of it takes place in a particular compartment of the train, must even throw a kitchen sink into the mix. This is an absurdly entertaining film.",yes
34,"
In recent years, audiences have seen a lot of beloved characters returning to long-running franchises for one last victory lap, such as Jurassic World Dominion and Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny. It is impossible to imagine any of those films' stars hanging on to those franchises for an almost thirty-year run, while still delivering the same high-octane stunts and adrenaline-fueled action that they were giving in 1996. 

With Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part 1, Tom Cruise once again reminds us that not only is he one of the last true movie stars, but he is also one of the last great action heroes. The seven Mission: Impossible films may be spread out across three decades, but there is no other franchise that operates the way Cruise does as Ethan Hunt—even James Bond can't keep the same actor in the role for that many movies. 

There's something to be said about consistency, and while there are some Mission: Impossible titles that rank above the rest, the first half of the Dead Reckoning duo delivers on all of its promises. It's very easy to forgive the loose—and sometimes nonsensical—plotline that kicks things off when your pulse is pounding in your ears and your knuckles have turned white from anxiously gripping the armrests. That is, after all, what the Mission: Impossible films have always been about: memorable action set pieces and a sort-of plot that gets pulled together in the background. 

Dead Reckoning's plot is actually one of the more compelling storylines that the franchise has introduced, mostly because it is uncomfortably relevant. Essentially, someone created an artificial intelligence (known as ""The Entity"") that rapidly evolved and got out of control. This omnipresent digital entity has been not-so-stealthily rifling through governments to learn from their resources and records like an evil mastermind, and now all of those governments want to take control of the AI for themselves. The hitch, of course, is that the key to controlling The Entity is a literal key—specifically, a two-piece cruciform key that everyone is looking for. And when you have a seemingly impossible mission, there's only one man you need to call: Ethan Hunt. 

The search for the key(s) brings Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) back into Ethan's circle, as well as Benji (Simon Pegg) and Luther (Ving Rhames), and it introduces a new plucky potential paramour in the form of Grace (Hayley Atwell)—who has also been enlisted to find, or rather, steal the keys for a big buyer. While the script doesn't necessarily give Ilsa, Benji, or Luther a lot to work with, the trio makes the most out of their screen time. Pegg, in particular, remains brilliant with his comedic timing, especially under duress. As a newcomer to Mission: Impossible, Atwell holds her own against the franchise's long-standing characters, both friend and foe. The cat-and-mouse game that Grace and Ethan embark on throughout most of the film is really anchored by the chemistry that Cruise and Atwell share. Ethan has always had a way of picking up strays across the films—something that Dead Reckoning points at directly—but his dynamic with Grace manages to feel fresh and new.  

While Cruise and Christopher McQuarrie haven't given any signals that Dead Reckoning is the end of Ethan Hunt or Mission: Impossible, the plotline does seem to be pointing in that direction, at least in a broad sense. While The Entity, and what it is capable of doing, is the overarching threat in Part 1, it's Gabriel (Esai Morales) who is the film's true villain—and a villain that goes all the way to the beginning for Ethan. Through flashbacks, we learn a little about their history, and those glimpses are enough to piece together the fact that everyone in Ethan's circle has a target painted on their back. Gabriel takes immense pleasure in the pain he inflicts on people, both physically and psychologically, and with the assistance of The Entity, he is far more sinister than any other foe Ethan has faced in the past. 


Gabriel isn't the only foe Ethan finds himself up against in Dead Reckoning, though the black-market arms dealer Alanna Mitsopolis (Vanessa Kirby), the assassin Paris (Pom Klementieff), and enforcers Briggs (Shea Whigham) and Degas (Greg Tarzan Davis) are hardly anything in comparison. The film rounds out its cast of characters with the questionably dubious government stiffs Eugene Kittridge (Henry Czerny) who was last seen in the first Mission: Impossible—another signal that Dead Reckoning is tying up loose ends—and Denlinger (Cary Elwes). 

Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part 2 already has a lot to live up to if it's going to top its predecessor. Dead Reckoning Part 1 delivers a surprising amount of situational humor, in between jaw-dropping stunts, heart-stopping action, and stomach-churning suspense. You will never look at Fiats or trains the same way after the credits roll on this one. While mind-bending stunts are an important touchstone for the franchise, Dead Reckoning doesn't forget the other key aspects of Mission: Impossible either. That iconic theme still delivers thrills and chills, and the mask gag never fails to impress. 

What works so well with the Mission: Impossible franchise, and Dead Reckoning in particular, is that it feels like a movie. It may seem pedantic to say that, but these films don't rely on CGI to deliver the action—they either make them work with Tom Cruise's fearless stuntwork or they find a practical way to make it look good. It's a breath of fresh air to see a film working to marry VFX and practical effects together in a way that doesn't feel unsettling to watch. With a plotline that is driven by the dangerous nature of artificial intelligence, which tricks and deceives, Dead Reckoning demanded this level of authenticity. 

Tom Cruise is once again bringing audiences back to theaters, and with Dead Reckoning it's for one hell of a ride. ",yes
35,"""Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning, Part One"" (everyone take a breath) is as busy and overstuffed as its title. After introducing the TV-based franchise in 1996, star and producer Tom Cruise has steadily upped the ante on spectacle and action; his stunts, which he famously insists on doing himself, have become part of worldwide marketing campaigns that wisely dispense with fiddly details like plot and dialogue and rely solely on the visual language of Cruise's body in space, doing amazing things.

That formula is executed with the chops and finesse we've come to expect from Cruise and director Christopher McQuarrie in ""Dead Reckoning,"" which delivers bombastic set pieces, bonkers plot elements and some (maybe unintentional?) hilarious dialogue in reliably metronomic style. It wouldn't be accurate to say there are any big surprises in ""Dead Reckoning"" — it's too faithful to the series's fundamentals to be accused of novelty — but therein lies its chief virtue. Like ""Top Gun: Maverick"" last year, ""Dead Reckoning"" might be just what we need right now: a two-hour-plus session of cinematic self-care, wherein the chases, fights, mayhem, exegetical speeches and jaw-dropping derring-do knit together to form a comforting weighted blanket of pure escapism and reassurance.

The man doing the knitting, of course, is Cruise, who as Ethan Hunt brings a subdued sense of world-weariness to the coolest agent of the Impossible Mission Force. In ""Dead Reckoning,"" Ethan is doing battle with an invisible, Oz-like blob called the Entity, an artificial intelligence program that is on the verge of going sentient and ending the world as we know it. Fans familiar with Cruise's fierce loyalty to the big-screen experience will recognize the not-so-subtle digs that permeate ""Dead Reckoning,"" which turns out to be a celebration of All Things Analog, including gravity-defying physical stunts that were performed with as little computerized gimmickry as possible. As Ethan fights the unseen force that might upend the world order, Cruise is fighting right along with him, against the algorithm that threatens to annihilate the very medium that made him a star.

Cruise and his alter ego do all this with their on-brand blend of insouciance and intensity; one of the best things about the ""Mission: Impossible"" movies is how Cruise and McQuarrie (who wrote the script with Erik Jendresen) know just when to pull back from the self-seriousness to deliver a conspiratorial wink at the audience. During the film's 30-minute cold open, we travel from a Russian submarine in the Bering Sea to a situation room in Washington, where intelligence officials deliver snippets of expository dialogue so dramatically that it has to be a joke. (The presence of Rob Delaney in the mix adds an amusing twist.) The humor in ""Dead Reckoning"" continues apace — not by way of snark or self-amused irony, but through stagecraft, as in a fabulous scene of multiple mistaken identities set in the Abu Dhabi airport, or when Ethan pops up speaking flawless Italian in a Rome police station.

Those are just two stylish, far-flung locations in a globe-trotting movie that takes Ethan from the Arabian Desert, where he reunites with Rebecca Ferguson's Ilsa Faust, to parts east, west and in between. As always, Cruise surrounds himself with a superbly accomplished supporting cast — not just the sleekly sophisticated Ferguson, but Vanessa Kirby, Ving Rhames and Simon Pegg all reprise characters from past installments. Esai Morales makes an impressively handsome debut as a new-old foil. And Hayley Atwell delivers a game, bracingly alert portrayal of a silkily gifted pickpocket who becomes Ethan's accomplice in saving the world from becoming an apocalyptic slough of deepfakes, misinformation and Orwellian surveillance.

But first — a car chase while handcuffed together driving a microscopic yellow Fiat, careering through the streets of Rome like a demented billiard ball. Or Ethan driving his motorcycle off a cliff in order to parachute down to save the day. Or those wonderful latex masks, peeled off to deliver those classic reveals. That mysterious green haze that knocks everyone out at opportune moments. And all that running and driving and jumping and executing the plan. (If you forget the plan, ""Dead Reckoning"" features plenty of human footnotes to provide helpful reminders.) It's fast, it's furious, and it's a lot of fun.

In fact, there are moments in ""Dead Reckoning"" when viewers could be forgiven for thinking they'd stepped into a Fast & Furious movie, or even ""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"" — there are that many overlapping bits: guy on a horse, check; crazy stunt on the Spanish Steps, check; visual joke with a tiny car, check; trains, motorcycles, exotic locales, check, check, check. It can all get silly, and kind of speechy. But in ""Dead Reckoning,"" the funhouse distractions are deployed, not as a barrage of concussive, over-edited CGI fakery, but as graceful and exhilarating nods to a tradition that goes as far back as Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd.

Nowhere is that lineage more evident — and honored — than in ""Dead Reckoning's"" wowzer of a finale, a ""Perils of Pauline"" callback that makes that little trick on the motorcycle look like a kid popping a wheelie on his Sting-Ray. It's a deliciously old-school nod to the elements of cinematic style: runaway trains, ticking time bombs, improbably long-winded villains and damsels in distress (but, in this case, not before they've proved their pugilistic bona fides). And Cruise is at the center of it all, with his singular focus and all-in commitment. The good news isn't just that ""Dead Reckoning"" lives up to its star's notoriously high standards; it's that it isn't even over yet.",yes
36,"Tom Cruise's latest is ""high tech"", full of stunts, and pays homage to past crime capers, writes Nicholas Barber.
Tom Cruise's seventh Mission: Impossible film is an unusual mix of high-tech and low-tech, of ultra-modern and defiantly traditional. The villain in Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One (let's call it Mission: Impossible 7 or M:I-7 for short) isn't even a human being, but a sentient artificial intelligence called The Entity. It isn't content with stealing jobs from hardworking journalists, like so many AIs. It wants to have total control of every scrap of information on Earth. This all seems horribly plausible, and, in one early scene, the threat is illustrated by one of the film's few memorable images (stunts aside): a room full of typists hurriedly transferring the intelligence services' data to paper so that The Entity can't read it.     
Soon afterwards, though, the film's director and co-writer, Christopher McQuarrie, establishes that M:I7 isn't a story about tech bros or computer viruses. It turns out that the only way to defeat the AI is with a little metal key made of two pieces that slot together, and which people tend to wear on thin chains around their necks, as if they were no more important than the keys to their bike locks. Yes, it's the kind of McGuffin that Alfred Hitchcock might have considered old-fashioned. Despite all the initial concern about an electronic super-brain conquering the world, the fate of civilisation is to be decided by pickpocketing and sleight of hand, riddles and puzzles, fist fights and knife fights, car chases and foot chases. The climactic sequence is set aboard a steam train which is chuffing its way through meadows and mountains, and the only technology that really matters is the device that makes the gang's lifelike rubber masks.   
Cruise and McQuarrie are paying sophisticated tribute to the glamorous European crime capers of the 1950s and 1960s

Maybe M:I7 doesn't ultimately have much to say about our current fears, but that's a relief. Cruise and McQuarrie are paying sophisticated tribute to the glamorous European crime capers of the 1950s and 1960s, and that's a welcome choice at a time when we all have so much to worry about. The film's signature stunt, the one on the posters and in the trailers, involves Cruise driving a motorbike off the edge of a cliff and then freefalling for a while before opening his parachute. But even this death-defying feat is played for knowing laughs. We're not expected to believe for a second that the stunt is essential to the plot. But it is nice to see Cruise enjoying himself.     

It's nice to see an old friend, too. Henry Czerny played Kittridge, an Impossible Missions Force officer, in the first Mission: Impossible film in 1996, and he is back in this one as the head of the whole operation. After he explains the situation, Ethan assembles his usual crew, a confident computer boffin (Ving Rhames), a panicky computer boffin (Simon Pegg), and a rogue MI6 agent (Rebecca Ferguson). They soon discover that The Entity has an evil sidekick, Gabriel (Esai Morales), with links to Ethan's past: we learn more about his pre-IMF days than we did in any of the previous films, although that's not saying much. Gabriel has his own sidekick, a gleefully ferocious assassin played by Pom Klementieff (Mantis from Guardians of the Galaxy), and he works with the White Widow (Vanessa Kirby), the seductive fixer from Mission: Impossible 6. Oh, and there is also an odd couple of CIA agents (Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis) who have the job of making a mess of things whenever they can.  

They're an amusing bunch of characters, but the fun doesn't really get started until everyone is chasing everyone else around Abu Dhabi airport. Just when Ethan is about to get hold of the key, he is outfoxed by Grace, a sleek thief played by Hayley Atwell, and presumably named after Grace Kelly. From then on, she keeps giving him the slip, and she keeps giving the film a fizzy air of mischief and irreverence. The luminous Atwell also manages to have more humanity than anyone else in the series. If Ethan remains as grimly focused on his mission as ever, Grace actually has a character arc, as her encounters with the IMF stir feelings of terror and nobility that she's never known before. You'd be tempted to say that she had a teasing romantic relationship with Ethan, but Cruise is no Cary Grant, and Ethan is too sexless for romance: only in the Mission: Impossible franchise could a film co-starring Atwell, Kirby, Ferguson and Klementieff be so chaste.

Still, Cruise and Atwell's jokey interplay ensures that M:I7 is bright and likeable, and doesn't feel as long as its two-and-three-quarter-hour running time. It's not quite up there with Top Gun: Maverick, though. After all the delays, and all the reports of Cruise's dogged labours to keep the production going during the pandemic, it isn't the masterpiece that we might have hoped for. The doom-and-gloomy interludes jar with the breezier stuff, and the violence towards women is hard to stomach. The solemn exposition scenes are tedious, too: McQuarrie's favourite technique is to have several characters taking it in turns to say a phrase each, so that their spiel almost sounds like dialogue, but he isn't fooling anyone.",yes
37,"Like its star, Mission: Impossible refuses to get old. As other franchises rise and fall, and Bond takes a breather, this one-time Cold War telly potboiler only gets more nimble and energised. They can – and probably will – keep making them for as long as Tom Cruise can sprint, leap or look slightly quizzical around mysterious women. With the steady hand of Christopher McQuarrie at the tiller, its seventh entry doesn't disappoint. 

McQuarrie has always been a sophisticated screenwriter (he won an Oscar for The Usual Suspects), but he's become an action director of real chops, too. Propelled by Lorne Balfe's beefy score, Dead Reckoning is operatic and muscular, with locations (Rome and Venice, especially) that park IMF tanks on James Bond's lawn and set pieces so huge, high-paced and helter-skelter, you worry the film might pull something.

It helps to have Cruise doing it all for himself – no stunt doubles and not much green screen here – as well as a swirling camera to strap you in for the ride. Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames's enjoyably quick-riffing agents, Benji and Luther, are back to pull the 'you're not about to do that?!' faces. 

The opening 20 minutes are a big ol' brain dump. Introduced is a sunken Russian sub housing a malevolent, self-aware A.I. called 'The Entity', a two-part key that offers the film its McGuffin, a harrowing loss from Ethan's past and the return of snaky Mission: Impossible OG Kittridge (Henry Czerny). Ethan is again instructed to 'pick a side', never a straightforward task when there's so many to choose from. One breakneck car chase culminates in a gun battle involving four – FOUR – different parties, zipping bullets around. One is a team of keystone US agents so far behind the eight-ball, they're practically in Mission: Impossible – Fallout. The stakes are high but Dead Reckoning never forgets to have fun or send up its own less plausible elements (there's a great gag that involves strenuous efforts to 'unmask' people who aren't wearing masks).

    Blockbuster escapism doesn't get much better

The new additions fit in seamlessly. The excellent Hayley Atwell channels Grace Kelly in To Catch a Thief as a light-fingered felon called, well, Grace who is drawn into the IMF's perilous world, although McQuarrie struggles to extract much Hitchcockian sizzle from the intimate moments. Chivalrous in a sexless way, Cruise's Hunt is more at ease tear-arsing through Rome in a supercharged Fiat 500 like a maniac Mr Bean than getting up close with Grace or his old flame Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). 

Happily, the charismatic Esai Morales's villain, Gabriel, is here to up the sauce, with Guardians of the Galaxy's Pom Klementieff as his gleefully psychotic henchperson (think Christopher Walken and Grace Jones in A View to a Kill).

Suave, genteel and ruthless, Gabriel acts as the living embodiment of the A.I. – 'ChapGPT', if you will – with a godlike ability to predict the immediate future. It's a confident movie that lets its antagonist tell you what's about to happen, but few franchises are this well-grooved. Blockbuster escapism doesn't get much better.",yes
38,"Nobody ever watches a Mission:Impossible movie for the story. The series has been legendarily incoherent from the very first installment: a big part of the fun is the surprise reveals - there's always at least one mask-removing twist - as the Impossible Mission Force battles some world-ending threat that involves a mix of computer hacking and old-fashioned physical risk.

Much like the Fast & Furious franchise (which this resembles more than it would like to admit), it had a bumpy run after the first film, taking a few more movies to fully find its feet. The result now is a franchise stripped of everything but the basics. All but gone are the shock betrayals and complicated high-tech heists, replaced by what seems to be the sole remaining selling point: Tom Cruise risking his life doing incredible stunts he probably doesn't need to do.

As is traditional, the plot revolves around various factions trying to obtain an object that will give the owner global dominance - you know, like the plot of the current Indiana Jones movie, only the hi-tech is ultra-modern rather than steeped in antiquity - but this time the object (a key) comes in two parts so double the chase sequences.

All the usual suspects are back: hacker Luther (Ving Rhames), slightly more energetic hacker Benji (Simon Pegg), with pickpocket Grace (Hayley Atwell) possibly being of use to the IMF while ex-MI6 agent Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) continues to be out there going rogue. Even IMF boss Eugene Kitterage (Henry Czerny) returns for the first time since the first film to be somewhat competent yet never quite ahead of our hero Ethan Hunt (Cruise).

For a film where the action sequences are so carefully worked out, the story is a bit of a mess, and not just in the usual ""let's keep the audience guessing"" fashion. It's your standard globe-trotting between action set pieces (at one point they stop in at a nightclub seemingly awaiting a visit from John Wick) while various evil forces - and some good guys led by Jasper Briggs (Shea Whigham, in his usual flustered but competent mode) - join the fray.

This is yet another blockbuster that's either tapped into the zeitgeist or is stitched together out of bits of other recent blockbusters, only more so. Often we know major plot points before any of the characters do, while one major development is that an important gadget breaks for no reason; the standard scene where everyone explains everything to each other takes place while Hunt is off riding a motorcycle elsewhere. Hopefully someone fills him in before part two.

The big bad here is a self-aware computer program known as ""the Entity"" that is designed to falsify data but is also so good at reading patterns it can predict the future. Every government in the world wants to use it, while letting it roam free will result in an internet where nothing can be trusted (clearly this movie is set in 2016 and the good guys lose).

There's a clear split set up here between the virtual bad guys - Gabriel (Esai Morales), a sinister figure from Ethan's past who's never been mentioned before is the Entity's embodied henchman, with hitwoman Paris (Pom Klementieff) by his side - and the physical IMF force. One works online and has everything under control, the other is clearly winging it and specialises in physical deception and running around a lot. The film doesn't really do anything with this split, but it does add a nice contrast.

Much more importantly, the action scenes - which are the whole point of this relentlessly energetic film - are very good. Setting-wise they're not always that inventive (there's a car chase through the streets of Rome a la the last Fast & Furious film) but they're extremely well crafted whether they're going for blunt force or fluid motion, and they often have enough of a sense of humour to them to work as more than just a pile of increasingly unlikely developments. 

All the really big stunts are in the trailers, but that doesn't lessen their impact here. The final sequence on board the Orient Express (which seems to still be a steam train in the M:I universe) is worth the price of admission alone, an ever-escalating series of nail-biting events where Cruise riding a motorbike off a cliff and parachuting away is only the mid-point.

Also, despite the whole ""part one"" thing, this actually has a solid, satisfying ending. Ironically enough, this only makes the prospect of the next installment more appealing. Who knew that making a good film was the way to get people interested in your next one?",yes
39,"Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, a continuation of Tom Cruise's collaborations with filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie, inches closer to the finish line. The last several installments have evoked the TV show heritage of the franchise with endings that fully resolve their plots while still leaving room to move forward — an adventure of the week vibe, if you will. Because the seventh film is the first of two parts, its conclusion is slightly more pronounced without a reset to reaffirm the status quo. Nonetheless, Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One is a fantastic showcase for Cruise's dedication to death-defying stunts.

Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One has a darker start than its immediate predecessors, Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation (2015) and Mission: Impossible – Fallout (2018), and it's also more intentionally funny. The connection between Ethan Hunt (Cruise) and his teammates remains more sincerely sympathetic than the James Bond franchise, more thoroughly articulated than the John Wick series and more tensile than the Fast & Furious films. The age of Cruise's franchise, however, shows in Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, as the Impossible Mission Force (IMF) members will all look like a geriatric crew of The Expendables' protagonists if producers don't wrap up the series soon. Meanwhile, Ving Rhames' Luther Stickell remains the tech genius and emotional core of the team.

Rebecca Ferguson returns as the enigmatic ex-MI6 agent Ilsa Faust, starring in a sort of dramatically choreographed duel against the eye-catching Gabriel (Esai Morales). Despite drawing on a never-before-seen connection, this dynamic adds weight to the male antagonist's fanatical-messianic presence and Hunt's vendetta against him. Pom Klementieff adds more peril as Paris, a brutal and menacing co-henchman who, despite a lack of dialogue, conducts maniacal violence quite impressively; a different performance from her character Mantis in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017). Vanessa Kirby returns from Mission: Impossible – Fallout as The White Widow, a callous and sophisticated black market arms and information dealer (also the daughter of Max from 1996's Mission: Impossible) who likes to play in grey areas between nation-states, continuing to highlight the murky moral waters and unsure alliances at play in diplomacy and espionage, thus strengthening the film's tone.

Hayley Atwell makes her franchise debut as Grace, an expert thief drawn into the story through the familiar plot device of a job looping a character into shenanigans outside her comfort zone. Grace's arc echoes Ilsa's as Ethan's unconsummated love interest, though the romance is initially less clear, as she is simply caught in the middle of an IMF mission. Still, Ilsa and Grace are different enough that the latter character's skillset and personality provide more of a fish-out-of-water and improvisational vibe, rather than slotting her in as a mere replacement.
It's interesting to compare the sexlessness of the contemporary Mission: Impossible romances with the franchise's early films. This may be the one area where the Fast & Furious franchise edges Cruises's series, though Hunt's penchant for longing looks and deep hugs reinforces that this is a self-imposed discipline for the wellbeing of the character's love interests — sexual austerity for the sake of the greater good.
The singular hero concept in Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One is also thematically tied around the compromised choices people make to join the IMF. One end of this informs the exposition, while another is a recruitment conversation that feels nearly cult-like (one of the odder scenes in the film). It fits the framing, but in being part of a narrative about Hunt's dedication, it is therefore focusing on Cruise — a longtime member of a secretive and controversial religious sect, and it's simply written somewhat jarringly in its evangelism, if not entirely out-of-place. The only other real problem is that the last big set piece goes on long enough for the CGI to show. This may be forgivable, however, given the adhesive it adds to the various character relationships.
Like several recent studio films, Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One finishes without resolving everything, but it does so more spectacularly and satisfyingly than most. McQuarrie and co-writer Erik Jendresen had the decency to conclude a primary struggle while allowing further problems to hang provocatively. Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One is the best franchise film since the fourth installment and possibly the best yet, tying continuity from Mission: Impossible to Mission: Impossible – Fallout, and setting up an extraordinary follow-up film, irrespective of whether another franchise installment comes later.",yes
40,"His nickname should be The Unstoppable Tom Cruise. After the amazing success of Top Gun: Maverick, a film that many deemed to save movie theaters after the pandemic, he doesn't slow down, he revs the engine back up. The last standing movie star left me in awe after Mission: Impossible- Fallout, so the idea of going up a level with Mission: Impossible- Dead Reckoning Part One seemed like an impossible bar to reach. But that's the point of Cruise. He accepts the challenge. He has to do it because if he doesn't then nobody will. It's that kind of bold and daring approach to creating cinematic entertainment that forces us to give Cruise our praise. He is an artist of action and big movie thrills. He's unstoppable and the world is better for it.

After the entire network of super spies and mercenaries were gunning for Etan Hunt (Cruise) in Fallout, things begin with a reset, with Ethan patiently waiting for his next mission. The task is that a supercomputer has gone rogue, an entity that can control all technology and weaponry. At one point it was controlled by the Russians in a submarine, but now the key that operates the entity has gone missing, two separate pieces, and now Ethan and his team must locate it before it gets into the hands of bad people.

From the narrative standpoint, this Mission feels like it is going back to the beginning, using fake masks, Ethan using his skill of magic, and the higher-ups in the CIA trying to keep tabs on the MIF. They are a rogue agency, with the returning faces of Luther (Ving Rhames), Benji (Simon Pegg), and mysterious agent Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), all tasked with aiding Ethan in his pursuit of the key. Added into the equation is a stealthy thief named Grace (Hayley Atwell), who picks the pocket of the wrong person, getting herself involved in a fight she could not see coming.

Director Christopher McQuarrie, along with co-writers Bruce Geller, and Erik Jendresen certainly understand the concept of pacing, when to turn up the action, and when to dial it back. The stunts are always the centerpiece of the Mission films, but what continues to fascinate is how McQuarrie and team remember the past, installing shootout sequences reminiscent of Michael Mann's Heat, motorcycle chases that pay homage to The Great Escape, and fights on a train that would make Buster Keaton applaud. It's not just about the action in the Mission: Impossible movies. It's obvious that it's a labor of love to the heights that cinema can reach.

Typically the Mission movie's (or really any movie in general) success can be hinged on the veracity of its villains. At this point, Ethan is a marked man and the number of villains is turned up. Although this group is not as cool as what Henry Cavill brought in Fallout, McQuarrie and Cruise are making sure we know that AI is the enemy of us all. The problem is if this technology gets into the wrong hands. Esai Morales is a ghost from Ethan's past as Gabriel, a man hellbent on destroying lives on his way to controlling power. We also meet ruthless mercenary Paris (Pom Klementieff) hunting Ethan for sport, while CIA agent Briggs (Shea Whigham) is always one step behind his former co-worker. You throw in the return of the White Widow (Vanessa Kirby) and you wonder exactly how Ethan could ever survive.

You throw on top of the never-ending motor of Tom Cruise and Mission: Impossible- Dead Reckoning Part One is another spectacular achievement. It's slightly stunted by overstuffed dialogue, with debates about who will act first, or the impending doomsday caused by the entity, but any issues are quickly brushed aside for the next best action sequence. Tom Cruise is the last living movie star and he continues to shock us with his drive for authentic action. He jumps off cliffs, fights on moving trains, runs for miles, and he genuinely puts his life at risk. This Mission: Impossible is a pure adrenaline rush, Dead Reckoning is only part one so you know he's gearing up to do more crazy stunts. The industry of movies, the history of cinema, and audiences looking for thrills, it's all on the shoulders of one unstoppable man. That is why this is one Mission you have to accept.",yes
